/* op_follow.s */
/*
	op_follow implements the string relational operator "]" ("follows"):

		lhs ] rhs

	lhs ("left-hand-side") and rhs ("right-hand-side") are expressions
	interpreted as strings.  If lhs follows rhs in the ASCII collating
	sequence, the resulting	relation is true, otherwise, false (actually,
	this function differs slightly -- see description of exit conditions
	below).

	According to the ANSI standard, ANSI/MDC X11.1-1990, the relation is
	true iff any of the following is true:

		a.  rhs is empty and lhs is not.
		b.  neither lhs nor rhs is empty and the leftmost character of
		    lhs follows (has numeric code greater than) the leftmost
		    character of rhs.
		c.  There exists a positive integer n such that lhs and rhs have
		    identical heads of length n (i.e., $E(lhs,1,n)=$E(rhs,1,n))
		    and the remainder of lhs follows the remainder of rhs.

	Entry:
		r0 -> lhs mval
		r1 -> rhs mval

	Exit:
		r0 =	>0, if lhs follows rhs
			 0, if lhs equals rhs
			<0, if rhs follows lhs (allows reversal of operands and
			    subsequent test)
