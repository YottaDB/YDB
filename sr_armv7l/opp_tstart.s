/* opp_tstart.s */

/*
 * Wrapper for op_tstart that rebuffers the arguments and adds an arg to the front of the list to so op_tstart
 * knows whether it was called from generated code or from C code since it handles TP restarts differently in
 * those cases. This routine also saves/reloads the stackframe and related pointers because on an indirect call
 * op_tstart() may shift the stack frame due to where it needs to put the TPHOST mv_stent.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    arg0:      (int) SERIAL flag
 *    arg1:      (mval *) transaction id
 *    arg2:	 -2	preserve all variables
 *		 -1	not restartable
 *		 >= 0	count of local vars to be saved/restored
 *    arg3-...:  (mval *) list of (arg2) mvals (continuing on stack if needed) containing the NAMES of variables
 *               to be saved and restored on a TP restart.
