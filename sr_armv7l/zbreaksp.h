/* The ZBreak command operates by finding the generated code for the op_linestart or op_linefetch for the source
 * line in question and changing the offset in the transfer table load address instruction from the op_linestart or
 * op_linefetch offset to the appropriate zbreak functionality opcode offset.
 * In some platforms(IA64 and ZOS) since the INSTRUCTION LAYOUT is complex we need following
 * macros for instruction manipulation.
 *      EXTRACT_OFFSET_TO_M_OPCODE
 *      FIX_OFFSET_WITH_ZBREAK_OFFSET
 *      EXTRACT_AND_UPDATE_INST
 * These macros are called only when COMPLEX_INSTRUCTION_UPDATE is defined
 * If COMPLEX_INSTRUCTION_UPDATE is not defined portable code in the caller of these macros
 * is invoked.
