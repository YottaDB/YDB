 * Routine to save the address of the *start* of this call along with its context as the restart point should this
 * process encounter a restart situation (return from $ZTRAP or outofband call typically).
 *
 * Since this is a leaf routine (makes no calls), the stack frame alignment is not important so is not adjusted
 * or tested. Should that change, the alignment should be fixed and implement use of the CHKSTKALIGN macro made.
