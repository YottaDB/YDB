/* op_mprofextexfun.s */

/*
 * op_extexfun calls an external GT.M MUMPS routine with arguments and provides for
 * a return value in most instances. If the routine has not yet been linked into the
 * current image, op_extexfun will first link it by invoking the auto-ZLINK function.
 * Before driving the function, we check if *any* routines have been linked in as
 * autorelink-enabled or if any directories are autorelink-enabled and if so, drive
 * a check to see if a newer version exists that could be linked in.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *  - arg0 (r0) - Index into linkage table of caller containing the routine header
 *	          address of the routine to call (rtnidx).
 *  - arg1 (r1) - Index into linkage table of caller containing the address of an
 *		  offset into routine to which to transfer control associated with
 *	          a given label. This value is typically the address of the lnr_adr
 *		  field in a label entry (lblidx).
 *  - arg2 (r2) - Address of where return value is placed or NULL if none (ret_value).
 *  - arg3 (r3) - Bit mask with 1 bit per argument (ordered low to high). When bit is
 *		  set, argument is pass-by-value, else pass-by-reference (mask).
 *  Pushed on stack
 *  - arg4	- Count of M routine parameters supplied (actualcnt).
 *  - arg5	- List of addresses of mval parameters (actual1).
 *
 * Note if lblidx (arg1) is negative, this means the linkage table to use is not from the
 * caller but is contained in TREF(lnk_proxy) used by indirects and other dynamic
 * code (like callins).
 *
 * Note we use r8 as a flag that we don't do more than one of auto_zlink() OR auto_relink_check()
 * call. This keeps us out of any possible loop condition as only one or the other should
 * ever be necessary. Register r8 is also known as REG_LITERAL_BASE and is saved by the putframe
 * macro so we need not save it separately.
