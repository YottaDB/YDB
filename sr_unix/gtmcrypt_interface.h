 * Find the key by hash and database path and set up database encryption and decryption state objects, if not created yet. Use this

 * operations on any database that will use this key, unless already initialized. If the db_path argument specifies a non-null
 * string, then the key should additionally correspond to that database in the configuration file.
 *
 * The reason that any database relying on the same key may use the same encryption and decryption state objects is this: Every
 * database's encryption and decryption handles are initialized with a null IV, and every block is processed using either a null IV
 * or IV corresponding to the block number. So, for every encryption and decryption operation the IV is always preset to the
 * "correct" value, effectively making it suitable for every database using the same hash.
 *
 * Arguments:	handle		Pointer to the database encryption state object supplied by the caller and filled in by this
 * 				routine.
 * 		key_hash	Hash of the key.
 * 		db_path		Path to the database file that should be associated with the sought key. Can be an empty string.
 * 		iv		Initialization vector to use for encryption or decryption.
