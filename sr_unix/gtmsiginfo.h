/* States of exit_state
 *
 * Normal state is no exit is pending. When we receive a signal, we are either going
 * to go into a pending state (wait until out of crit) or an immediate state (going
 * to exit now). There are two different pending states. In the first, we can tolerate
 * another (2nd) signal which will bump us to final pending state. If a 3rd signal
 * comes in, we will go to the immediate exit state [tolerant pending state added at the
 * request of Roger 4/2000]. If one of the terminal signals is received (i.e. not
 * sent by another user, we will go to the immediate exit state.
