/* Note: GT.M code *MUST NOT* use the sleep function because it causes problems with GT.M's timers on some platforms. Specifically,
 * the sleep function results in SIGARLM handler being silently deleted on Solaris systems (through Solaris 9 at least). This leads
 * to lost timer pops and has the potential for system hangs. The proper long sleep mechanism is hiber_start which can be accessed
 * through the LONG_SLEEP macro defined in mdef.h.
 *
 * On Linux boxes be sure to define USER_HZ macro (in gt_timers.c) appropriately to mitigate the timer clustering imposed by
 * the OS. Historically, the USER_HZ value has defaulted to 100 (same as HZ), thus resulting in at most 10ms accuracy when
 * delivering timed events.

/* Nonetheless, because we continue to press for the highest time discrimination available, where posible we use
 * clock_nanosleep and clock_gettime, which, while currently no faster than gettimeofday(), do eventually promise
 * sub-millisecond accuracy
 *
 * Because, as of this writing, in AIX the clock_* routines are so erratic with short times we use the functions above for most
 * things but give the following macro a separate name so AIX can use it in op_hang.c to ensure that a 1 second sleep always
 * puts the process in a different second as measured by $HOROLOG and the like.
