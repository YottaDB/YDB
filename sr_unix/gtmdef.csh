#	gtmdef.csh - set up initial GT.M environment variables
#
#	This shell script corresponds to the VMS script
#	gtmdef.com which defines all of the system globals for
#	the Greystone GT.M development environment.  I.e.,
#	each of the following 'setenv' commands is intended to
#	be roughly equivalent to the VMS 'define/system'
#	command.
#
#	To duplicate this effect as much as possible, this
#	script should be invoked as soon as possible after
#	shell startup (see gtm_cshrc.csh).
