/* This function initializes the IO devices in preparation for a later call-in invocation.
 * This usually needs to be invoked from a C program using simpleAPI after having manipulated the stdout/stderr
 * file descriptors 1 & 2 (for example, if it has done a "dup2" to redirect those descriptors to
 * a different file). In that case, this function reinitializes the M IO context ($P etc. based on the
 * current 1 & 2 descriptors). This is particularly useful in case a C program that is running the child
 * after a "fork" and "ydb_child_init" call has reset 1 & 2 to point to .mjo and .mje files (whereas the parent
 * process had both 1 & 2 pointing to the same physical file). Not doing the "ydb_stdout_stderr_adjust" in this
 * case will cause any error messages that get displayed in the child process while it does a call-in to show
 * up in the .mjo file (instead of the .mje file).
