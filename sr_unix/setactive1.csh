#	setactive1.csh - auxiliary script for setactive.csh
#			 (based on the VMS script GTM$COM:SETACTIVE.COM)
#
#	Because setactive.csh must set environment variables, it cannot be run as a subproces,
#	but rather must be source'd.  Unfortunately, the logic required is too complex (due,
#	apparently to problems buffering the command input stream), so setactive.csh invokes
#	this shell script as a subprocess to deal with the logic.  In order to pass information
#	back to the parent process, setactive1.csh writes a shell script to be source'd by the
#	parent process on completion.
#
#	Arguments:
#		$1 - new version (a, d, p, or specific version number)
#		$2 - image type (b, d, or p for bta, dbg, or pro)
#		$3 - 1 => interactive invocation, prompt for input and correcctions
#		     0 => non-interactive invocation
#		$4 - name of file to which to write setenv commands
#			(probably somewhere in /tmp)
#
#	At exit:
#		$status	== 0 => success
#			!= 0 => failure
#
#		If $status == 0, then the file named in $4 contains the necessary set and
#		setenv commands to effect a change of GT.M version.  This file should be
#		source'd by setactive.csh.
#
#	N. B. Most of the labels aren't actually used; they're just for cross-reference with
#	the VMS GTM$COM:SETACTIVE.COM file.
