/* Routine to do the following:
 *
 * 1. Stop M-Profiling.
 * 2. Unwind the M stack back to level 1
 * 3. (re)Initialize $ECODE, $REFERENCE and $TEST.
 * 4. Remove all triggers. This includes not only the trigger routines but the trigger definitions and
 *    linkages in the gvt_trigger struct anchored off of the gv_target.
 * 5. Unlink all M routines. This includes getting rid of their linkage entries, breakpoints,
 *    and $TEXT() caches and re-initializing the routine table.
 * 6. Empty the indirect cache.
 * 7. Close the shared libraries associated with M programs and reopen them after the unroll if any
 *    are present in $ZROUTINES.
 *
 * Currently called from op_zgoto() but could be called from elsewhere if needed in the future.
 *
 * Note this routine removes all loaded programs but the intial base-frame on the stack has the address of whatever
 * the first program is (GTM$DMOD in a direct mode situation or the starting program in a -run invocation). It is up
 * to the caller to set the base frame with this address so the stack has no unknown references in it.
