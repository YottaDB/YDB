		 * READ_POOL state. But, since the instance has been rolled back, the journal pool cannot be relied upon in its
		 * entirety. To illustrate this -- consider that the journal pool contains the data from 1-100 and the source server
		 * is currently sending sequence number 30 and is reading from the pool. Assume an online rollback happens that
		 * takes the instance from sequence number 100 to sequence number 80 and leaves the journal pool write_addr and
		 * rsrv_write_addr untouched. Now, lets say GT.M process comes in after this and does a few more updates. All of
		 * these updates will be written in the journal pool right after the "old-rolled-back" sequence number 100. If the
		 * source server continues to read from the pool, it will send the valid data until sequence number 80. After that,
		 * it will start sending the "old-rolled-back" sequence numbers 81-100 which is not right. To avoid this, rollback
		 * should set the write_addr and rsrv_write_addr by searching in the journal pool for sequence number 81. This is
		 * currently not done, but is something that we can think about when it comes to optimization. Until then, force
		 * rollback to read only from the file until the current seqno (using gtmsource_save_read_jnl_seqno).
