#
# This block of demarcated code initializes the environment variables and aliases used by the offset program.
# If this program is used anywhere outside the Greystone development environment, care should be taken in doing the following.
#
# (a) This utility offset.csh needs the shell "tcsh" to exist in /usr/local/bin (a soft link would suffice too).
# (b) This utility also needs an accompanying awk script "offset.awk" to do primitive parsing of the C file.
# (c) The environment variable "gtm_src" should be set to point to the absolute pathname containing the C-source-file.
# (d) The environment variable "gtm_tools" should be set to point to the absolute pathname containing the "offset.awk" program.
# (e) The alias "gt_cc" should be set to the command for the C-compiler with appropriate flags (including #defines).
# (f) The alias "gt_ld" should be set to the command for the C-linker (cc or ld would do) with appropriate flags.
# (g) The environment variable "user" should be set to the appropriate user-name. Usually this is taken care of by the shell.
#
# Note that this utility creates temporary files for its processing in the form /tmp__${user}_offset_*
# It removes these files only in the case the offset determination was successful.
# Therefore care should be taken to avoid unintended proliferation of these temporary files in the system.
#
# Once the above changes have been done in place here, comment out the greystone-environment-specific-initialization below.
