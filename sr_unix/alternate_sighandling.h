/* A word about alternate signal handling - In normal signal handling, there are times that signals need to be bounded to
 * another thread to be properly processed. This is done by the FORWARD_SIG_TO_MAIN_THREAD_IF_NEEDED() macro but this
 * is unnecessary in alternate signal handling. The FORWARD_SIG_TO_MAIN_THREAD_IF_NEEDED() macro also does a lot of the
 * deferred signal handling in regular signal handling mode but again, there is limited reason to ever defer any signal
 * notification in alternate signal handling mode. The only signals we defer in alternate signal handling mode is SIGALRM
 * which can be deferred in either mode by the SET_DEFERRED_TIMERS_CHECK_NEEDED macro in gt_timers.c

 * signals are detected outside of YottaDB and we are notified of them and need to wait until we have the YDB engine lock. It
 * is possible for more than one signal (of different types) to be pending though that is expected to be rare.
