/* Routine to scan string in UTF8 mode finding a given character number using (and/or creating) lookaside
 * entries in the relevant string cache.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *   char_num      - index of character to be found.
 *   utf_parse_blk - parse block describing string and where scan starts/left-off. Note see utfcgr.h to see which fields in the
 *                   utf_parse_blk are used for input, return, or both.
 *
 * Returns:
 *   - Return code is TRUE is character was found, FALSE if it wasn't.
 *   - utf_parse_blk->scan_char_type describes what was found or not found:
 *	 a) Contains UTFCGR_EOL if ran off end of string before char_num char was found.
 *       b) Contains UTFCGR_BADCHAR if ran into a BADCHAR and utf_parse_blk->stoponbadchar was set which also sets
 *          utf_parse_blk->badcharstr and utf_parse_blk->badchartop to describe the buffer containing the badchar. If
 *          utf_parse_blk->stoponbadchar is not set, this value can be returned with a successful return which also then sets
 *          the "regular" return fields.
 *       c) Contains the character type of the located character which also sets the "regular" return vars.
 *
 * Note - this routine recognizes BADCHARs only in the portion of the string it "skips" to get to the
 * required character position. So for example, if a string is 2 "good" characters followed by a badchar,
 * locating positions 1, 2, or 3 won't trigger a badchar error but locating a char in position 4 would.
 *
 * The utfcgr_entry array is a series of groups of like characters. The value of typflags in a given group is the type of
 * the characters in that group but the other fields define the END of the group. For example, take the following string:
 *
 *     x="123"_$char(195,196)_"4"
 *
 * This would create 3 group entries as follows:
 *
 * utfcgr_entry[0]:
 *   typeflags = UTFCGR_ASCII
 *   charcnt = 3
 *   byteidx = 3
 * utfcgr_entry[1]:
 *   typeflags = UTFCGR_UTF
 *   charcnt = 5
 *   byteidx = 7
 * utfcgr_entry[2]:
 *   typeflags = UTFCGR_ASCII
 *   charcnt = 6
 *   byteidx = 8
 *
 * When the utfcgr.entry array for a given string is full, scanning past what is defined in the cache is dealt with by
 * good 'ole brute force scanning. The u_parhscan counter tracks these but only in debug mode (for now).
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   1. This routine does not obey badchar_inhibit but rather behaves according to the utf_parse_blk->stoponbadchar flag in
 *      the utf_parse_blk to have a bit of versatility. For example, if used eventually in an IO routine, we would pass TRUE
 *  	in utf_parse_blk->stoponbadchar regardless of the setting of badchar_inhibit.
 *
 *   2. When a cache is setup for a given string, it survives only until that cache entry is reused.
 *
 *   3. Stringpool garbage collection erases the cache because that is the only way to make sure the address/length
 *      cache validation check is assured to always be correct without false positives.
 *
 *   4. Routine has counters and indexes. Typically, when we are talking about byte indexes, we are talking
 *      about a 0 origin index since that's how the C language references them. When talking about characters
 *      we are generally talking about counts and since characters are not directly addressable because they
 *      are multi-byte in UTF8 mode, these generally have a 1 origin.
