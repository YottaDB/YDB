	 * detect a restartable condition, we are going to cause this region's triggers to be unloaded which destroys the block
	 * our parameter is pointing to so the restart logic MUST take place outside of this routine.
	 *
	 *   1. We have an active transaction due to an IMPLICIT TSTART done by trigger handling but the trigger level has not yet
	 *	been created. We don't need another TP wrapper in this case but we do need a condition handler to trap the thrown
	 *	retry to again prevent C stack unwind and return to the caller in the same shape that gtm_trigger would return.
	 *   2. We have an active transaction due to an EXPLICIT M-code TSTART command. For this case, the trigger loads proceed
	 *   	as normal with restarts handled in the regular automatic fashion. Note this case also covers the tp restarts done
	 *	by both the update process and mupip recover forward since those functions have their own way of intercepting and
	 *	dealing with restarts. To cover those cases, tp->implicit_tstart can be TRUE but tp_implicit_trigger MUST be
	 *	FALSE.
	 *   3. We have an active transaction due to an IMPLICIT TSTART done by trigger handling and one or more triggers are
	 *	running. This becomes like case 2 since the restart will be handled by gtm_trigger and the proper thing will
	 *	be done.
	 *
	 * An extra note about case 3. Case 3 can be the identified case if in a nested trigger we are in trigger-no-mans-land
	 * with a base frame for the nested trigger (having driven one of a set of parallel nested triggers) but no actual trigger
	 * execution frame yet exists. This is really a case 1 situation with a nested trigger but it turns out that dealing with
	 * like case 3 does the right thing because if/when mdb_condition_handler catches a thrown TPRETRY error, mdb_condition
	 * handler will peal the nested trigger frame off before doing the restart which works for us and avoids issues of
	 * multi-level implicit restarts we would otherwise have to handle.
	 *
	 * Note, this routine is for loading trigger source when the trigger is to be driven. The trigger_source_read_andor_verify()
	 * routine should be used when fetching trigger source for reasons other than driving the triggers. This routine is lighter
	 * weight but has a dependence on the restartability of the trigger-drive logic for getting the triggers reloaded as
	 * necessary.
