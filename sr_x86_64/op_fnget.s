# Note there is no stack padding for alignment and no check in this routine because it is a leaf routine
# so never calls anything else. The stack is unaligned by 8 bytes due to the return register but that is
# not an issue unless this routine calls something in the future in which case it needs changes to pad
# the stack for alignment and should then also use the CHKSTKALIGN macro to verify it.
