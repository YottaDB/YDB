#
# op_mprofextexfun calls an external GT.M MUMPS routine with arguments and provides for
# a return value in most instances. If the routine has not yet been linked into the
# current image, op_mprofextexfun will first link it by invoking the auto-ZLINK function.
# Before driving the function, we check if *any* routines have been linked in as
# autorelink-enabled or if any directories are autorelink-enabled and if so, drive
# a check to see if a newer version exists that could be linked in.
#
# Parameters:
#
#  - arg0 (%rdi) - Index into linkage table of caller containing the routine header
#	           address of the routine to call (rtnidx).
#  - arg1 (%rsi) - Index into linkage table of caller containing the address of an
#		   offset into routine to which to transfer control associated with
#	           a given label. This value is typically the address of the lnr_adr
#		   field in a label entry (lblidx).
#  - arg2 (%rdx) - Address of where return value is placed or NULL if none (ret_value).
#  - arg3 (%rcx) - Bit mask with 1 bit per argument (ordered low to high). When bit is
#		   set, argument is pass-by-value, else pass-by-reference (mask).
#  - arg4 (%r8)  - Count of M routine parameters supplied (actualcnt).
#  - arg5 (%r9)  - List of addresses of mval parameters (actual1).
#
# Note if lblidx (arg1) is negative, this means the linkage table to use is not from the
# caller but is contained in TREF(lnk_proxy) used by indirects and other dynamic
# code (like callins).
#
# Note the return address is also supplied (on the stack) but we remove that immediately
# since we do not return directly to it but to the the called rtn when the return address
# is loaded out of the top M stackframe by getframe.
#
# Note we use %r12 as a flag that we don't do more than one of auto_zlink() OR auto_relink_check()
# call. This keeps us out of any possible loop condition as only one or the other should
# ever be necessary. Register %r12 is also known as REG_LITERAL_BASE and is saved by the putframe
# macro so we need not save it separately.
#
# Note op_mprofextexfun is a near exact copy of op_extexfun differing only in the name and
# the version of new_stack_frame() it calls (calls new_stack_frame_sp() instead).
