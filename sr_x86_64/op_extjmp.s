#
# op_extjmp transfers control to an external GT.M MUMPS routine with no arguments
# by rewriting the existing M stack frame rather than stacking a new stack frame
# like most other forms of control transfer. If the routine to jump to has not yet
# been linked into the current image, op_extcall will first link it by invoking
# the auto-ZLINK function. Before driving the new routine, we check if *any* routines
# have been linked in as autorelink-enabled or if any directories are
# autorelink-enabled and if so, drive a check to see if a newer version exists that
# could be linked in.
#
# Parameters:
#
#  - arg0 (%rdi) - Index into linkage table of caller containing the routine header
#	           address of the routine to call.
#  - arg1 (%rsi) - Index into linkage table of caller containing the address of an
#		   offset into routine to which to transfer control associated with
#	           a given label. This value is typically the address of the lnr_adr
#		   field in a label entry
#
# Note if arg1 is negative, this means the linkage table to use is not from the
# caller but is contained in TREF(lnk_proxy) used by indirects and other dynamic
# code (like callins).
#
# Note the return address is also supplied (on the stack) but we remove that immediately
# since we do not return directly to it but to the the transfer rtn when the return address
# is loaded out of the top M stackframe by getframe.
#
# Note we use %r12 as a flag that we don't do more than one of auto_zlink() OR auto_relink_check()
# call. This keeps us out of any possible loop condition as only one or the other should
# ever be necessary. Register %r12 is also known as REG_LITERAL_BASE and is saved by the putframe
# macro so we need not save it separately.
