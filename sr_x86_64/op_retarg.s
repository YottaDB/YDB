#
# Routine to unwind the M stack returning a value. Note this routine burns the return value like many others
# but waits until the call is complete to do so. This better keeps the debugger trace-back information intact.
# But because we wait, we need an initial bump to the C stack pointer to get it aligned.
#
# Args:
#   REG64_RET0 - return value mval
#   REG64_RET1 - alias value flag
#

# Below line is needed to avoid the ELF executable from ending up with an executable stack marking.
# This marking is not an issue in Linux but is in Windows Subsystem on Linux (WSL) which does not enable executable stack.
