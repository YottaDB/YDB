# This routine is only ever "returned to" since its address stored into the mpc field of stack frames
# during certain types of error recovery. Because of that, there is no "return address" on the stack
# so this routine's call to opp_ret is the equivalent of a goto because opp_ret *will* unwind the caller's
# address. So this routine has no caller and no return. Nevertheless, we check the stack alignment to
# verify it before passing control to opp_ret for the unwind.

# Below line is needed to avoid the ELF executable from ending up with an executable stack marking.
# This marking is not an issue in Linux but is in Windows Subsystem on Linux (WSL) which does not enable executable stack.
