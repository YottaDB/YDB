/* This function is similar to "getenv" except that it is given an "envindx" instead of an env var name.
 * For a given index "envindx", this function checks in the ydbenvname[] table if that index has a non-zero string literal
 * and if so checks if an environment variable with that name is defined and if so uses that. If not, it checks in the
 * gtmenvname[] table if the same index has a non-zero string literal and if so uses that as the environment variable
 * to check if it is defined. This way, ydb* takes precedence over gtm* if both exist.
 * If "suffix" is non-NULL, that string is added to the environment variable name and the "getenv" is done on the resulting string.
 * If return value is not NULL and is_ydb_env_match is non-NULL,
 *	*is_ydb_env_match is set to TRUE if the ydb* env var matched and set to FALSE if the gtm* env var matched.
 *
 * Note: This module currently does not set the ydb* env var to be the same as the gtm* env var (like "ydb_trans_log_name" does)
 * as that involves handling errors which this is currently not set up to do. That is because this is invoked from the encryption
 * plugin and suid programs like "gtmsecshr" and so we want it to not pull in any more functions than absolutely necessary.
 * Adding a call to "rts_error_csa" would pull in a lot more than desirable. Therefore, it is the caller who has to take care
 * of issuing any appropriate errors or doing any ydb* "setenv" calls.
