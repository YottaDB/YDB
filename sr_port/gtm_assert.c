/*	gtm_assert - invoked via the "GTMASSERT" macro.
 *
 *	gtm_assert raises the ERR_GTMASSERT error condition which is
 *	intended to be a replacement for the ubiquitous ERR_GTMCHECK.   BYPASSOK
 *	It differs from ERR_GTMCHECK in that it indicates the module    BYPASSOK
 *	name and line number of its invocation so one can determine
 *	exactly which ERR_GTMASSERT caused the termination.
 *
 *	The "GTMASSERT" macro differs from the "assert" macro in that
 *	it is significant regardless of the definition or lack thereof
 *	of the macro "DEBUG" and is therefore valid for PRO images as
 *	well as for DBG and BTA images.
 *
 *	Note that the assertpro() macro is preferred in most instances where a specific condition
 *	is being tested.
