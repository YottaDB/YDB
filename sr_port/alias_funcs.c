/* Routine to repair the l_symtab entries in the stack due to hash table expansion such that the

 *
 * Note that the "repair" done by this routine depends on the special processing done in
 * expand_hashtab_mname (EXPAND_HASHTAB rtn in hashtab_implementation.h) which does not free the
 * old table and places the addresses of the new hash table entries in the the value of the old
 * hash table entries. This allows this routine to access the old table with the existing
 * l_symtab entries and pull the new values that should be put in the respective l_symtab
 * entries before it completes the cleanup and releases the old hash table.
 *
 * Operation - Loop through the stack and:
 *
 * 1) For each unique l_symtab, run through the entries in the l_symtab.
 * 2) If entry is null, skip.
 * 3) If entry falls within range of the old symbol table, load the address in it and verify
 *    that it falls within the range of the new symbol table.
 * 4) If the entry does not fall within the range of the old symtab:
 *    a) Stop the search as we must have run into an older symtab
 *    b) If debug, assert fail if this is not the first_symbol in this l_symtab we have seen
 *       since an l_symtab can only point to one symtab).
 * 5) Get new entry address from within the old entry.
 * 6) Debug only: Assert fail if the new entry address not in range of new symtab.
 * 7) Note that after procesing the stack to get to the l_symtab entries, we also process the
 *    mv_stent types that contain hash table entry pointers and have to be processed in the same
 *    fashion as the l_symtab entries. This processing saves us the hashtable lookup necessary to
 *    pop NEW'd or parameter values when undoing a stack level and restoring previous values.

/* When an xNEW'd symtab is popped, and there are alias concerns, this routine is called to make things right. Things that
 * can be wrong:
 * 1) If a variable was passed through to the new symtab and then was aliased to a var that belonged to the new symbol table,
 *    the lv_val in the old symtab was released and a new one assigned in the new symbol table. We have to:
 *    a) copy that value back to the previous symtab and
 *    b) we have to fix the reference count since the alias owned by the symtab being popped is going away.
 * 2) If a variable is passed through to the new symtab and within that variable an alias container is created that points
 *    to a var in the newer symtab we need to copy that var/array back to the older symtab so the value remains.
 * 3) This gets more interesting to deal with when that var is also aliased by a passed through variable (combining issues 1 & 2).
 *
 * Operation:
 * 1) When the new symtab was created by op_xnew, if there were variables that were passed through, they are recorded in the
 *    symtab chained from xnew_var_list.
 * 2) Go through that list of variables, lookup each in the popped symbol table and change the hash table entries to deleted
 *    so those entries are not found in subsequent scans.
 * 3) Do a more simplistic kill-alias-all in the popped symtab. This involves the following:
 *    a) Run the hash table looking for aliased variables. If found, do the reference count maintenance but don't worry about
 *       deleting any data since it will all go away after we return and unw_mv_ent() releases the symbol table and lv_blk chains.
 *    b) While running the hash table, run any variable trees we find anchored.
 *    Note we can only use the DECR_BASE_REF_LIGHT method when the lv_val is owned by the same symbol table as is being released.
 *    Else we need to use the regular DECR_BASE_REF() macro so the lv_val can be requeued to the proper queue and not be left in
 *    place where it causes problems later.
 * 4) Go through the list of forwarded vars again (xnew_var_list) in the popped symval and see if any of the lv_vals are owned
 *    by the symval being popped. If they are, then the lv_vals involved need to be copied to lv_vals owned by the (now)
 *    current symtab because the popped symtab's lv_vals will be released by unw_mv_ent() when we return. Note that this also
 *    involves going through the tree of these vars in case any container vars point to an array that is not being dealt with
 *    in some fashion by one of the other vars we passed through. We avoid processing arrays multiple times by marking them
 *    with an incremented lvtaskval.
 * 5) Go through the list of referenced lv_vals (via containers of xnew_var_list vars) by traversing the xnew_ref_list if it
 *    exists. These vars were recorded because we may not be able to get to them still just by traversing the reference list vars
 *    so they were pre-recorded so we could scan the worst case of vars that could have containers pointing to the symtab about
 *    to be popped.
 * 6) If a pending alias return value exists, check it to see if it also needs to be processed.
 *
 *    Note: to prevent re-scanning of already scanned array, this routine uses the lvtaskcycle value. To do this, we use the
 *    suspend_lvgcol global variable to tell "stp_gcol" to not do LVGC processing (which also uses lvtaskcycle).

/* Routine to do a garbage collection on the lv_vals in the current symbol table in order to detect if
 * there is any "lost data" which are 2 or more base lv_vals that point to each other thus keeping their
 * reference counts non-zero and prevent them from being deleted but otherwise have no entry in the hash table
 * themselves nor are linked to by any combination of container var linked arrays that do have an entry in
 * the hash table -- in other words, they are totally orphaned with no way to retrieve them so are effectively
 * dead but are not able to be killed in an automated fashion. This routine will find and kill those blocks
 * returning a count of the lv_vals thus found and killed.
 *
 * Operation:
 *
 * 1)  Run lv_blks which contain all lv_val structures in use for this symbol table.
 * 2)  Record each base lv_val in our version of the array used by stp_gcol. Base lv_vals can be identified
 *     by having a non-zero parent.sym field pointing to a block with type MV_SYM. There is one exception to this:
 *     In UNIX, the zsearch_var fields contains an lv_val that should not be released. Check for and avoid it.
 * 3)  Increment lvtaskcycle with which we will mark lv_vals as having been marked accessible as we discover them.
 * 4)  Go through the hashtable. Set the lvtaskcycle field to mark the lv_val "reachable".
 * 5)  If the lv_val has descendants, run the decendant chain to look for container vars.
 * 6)  The base lv_vals that container vars point to, if not already marked "reachable"  will be so marked and
 *     the search recursively invoked on the new var.
 * 7)  Do the same by running the mv_stent chain marking the temporarily displaced vars for parameters and NEW's as
 *     "reachable".
 * 8)  Do the same by running the TP stack marking local variable copies made for this symbol table as reachable.
 * 9)  Mark any pending return argument as "reachable".
 * 10) Once the "reachable" search is complete, run through the created list of lv_vals and locate any that were
 *     not reachable. If they remain undeleted (deleted will have parent.sym field zeroed), delete them.
 *
 * Note this routine uses the same buffer structure that "stp_gcol" uses except it loads its array with lv_val*
 * instead of mstr*. An address is an address..
