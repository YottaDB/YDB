/* gtm_assert2 - invoked via the "assertpro" macro.
 *
 * gtm_assert2 is driven by the assertpro() macro which is intended to be a replacement for
 * most instances of the GTMASSERT macro which gave no indication of the cause of the GTMASSERT
 * error. The GTMASSERT2 message output from this routine also contains the failing assertpro()
 * text very similar to what the ASSERT error does.
