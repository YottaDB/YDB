 * The structure of the parameter pool looks like this:
 *
 *  64-bit platforms:
 *   _____________________________|_________________|_______________________|_____
 *  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *  |  p  |  p  |  p  |  f  | m/c |  p  |  f  | m/c |  p  |  p  |  f  | m/c | ...
 *  |_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____
 *     0     1     2     3     4  |  5     6     7  |  8     9    10    11  |
 *
 *  32-bit platforms:
 *   _________________|___________|_________________|_____
 *  |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
 *  | p/p | p/f | m/c | p/f | m/c | p/p | f/- | m/c | ...

 *
 * In this example we store three sets of parameters, first having three, second having one, and
 * third having two parameters. In addition to that, each set also includes a frame field that
 * contains a pointer to the stack frame that the parameter set corresponds to, and mask_and_cnt
 * structure that holds the mask and count values for the parameters stored in the set (refer to
 * parm_pool.h). To always be able to properly populate this pool, we are maintaining a special
 * integer variable, start_idx, which indicates the offset past the mask_and_cnt slot of the
 * current parameter set.
 *
 * Because of alignment issues, on 32-bit platforms we will store two parameter pointers per slot;
 * the slot containing the last parameter will also store the frame field in case the number of
 * parameters is odd; the frame field is stored in an individual parameter otherwise. So, 4 bytes of
 * space are wasted (indicated by '-' in the illustration) on 32-bit platforms when the number of
 * parameters is even.
 *
 * If for some reason a stored parameter set is not read before a new set is stored (due to
 * out-of-band, error, or some other condition), then we can start recording new parameters at
 * start_idx because it already points to the first vacant slot. To guarantee that we will not
 * endlessly keep storing new parameters in the pool, we get rid of the last parameter set on a
 * stack frame unwind if that frame's address corresponds to the frame field of the parameter set.
 * This is achieved via PARM_ACT_UNSTACK_IF_NEEDED macro.
 *
 * For situations when the parameters are stored and subsequently read prior to unwinding the
 * respective stack frame, we increase the value of the set's actualcnt by SAFE_TO_OVWRT value,
 * which is a special *even* value that is guaranteed to be greater than MAX_ACTUALS, the maximum
 * number of parameters allowed to be passed to a label. Adding SAFE_TO_OVWRT, rather than
 * overwriting, accomplishes two purposes in our design: (1) the set is clearly marked to have been
 * used and thus disposable; (2) we can find out how many parameters the set had by subtracting
 * SAFE_TO_OVWRT from actualcnt. So, if we detect that the last parameter set stored in the pool has
 * already been used, we rewind start_idx by the number of slots occupied by that set (including
 * the ones alloted to frame and mask_and_cnt structures). Please note that the "rewind number" is
 * calculated differently on 64- and 32-bit architecture machines. Once we store a new set of
 * parameters, we advance start_idx by however many slots the new set occuppied, to point to the
 * next vacant slot.
 *
 * Although we do not expect a lot of parameters in the pool at the same time, we have a mechanism
 * of expanding the allocated storage. The initial allocation happens when the first set of
 * parameters is passed in the program. Subsequent allocations occur on if-needed basis, as decided
 * in push_parm().
