/* mutex_deadlock_check -- mutex deadlock detection check

   There are 2 possible cases at this point:

   1) This is not a TP transaction
   2) This is a TP transaction

   For case 1, when we come in here we should not have crit in any other region (except as noted below)
   so instruct have_crit to complain about and release any such regions it finds.
   For case 2, we should not have crit in regions that are not part of this transaction and regions
   with an "ftok" that is higher than the region for which we are presently grabbing crit.
   Since tp_reg_list is sorted by ftok, we can just run this list in order and mark the regions that are allowed
   to have crit with our current cycle number.
