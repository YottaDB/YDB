/* cacheflush stub
 *
 * Most hardware platforms on which GT.M is implemented use separate
 * instruction and data caches.  It is necessary to flush these caches
 * whenever we generate code in a data region in order to make sure
 * the generated code gets written from the data cache to memory and
 * subsequently loaded from memory into the instruction cache.
 *
 * Input:	addr		starting address of region to flush
 *		nbytes		size, in bytes, of region to flush
 *		cache_select	flag indicating whether to flus
 *				I-cache, D-cache, or both
 *
 * This stub is for those platforms that don't use separate data and
 * instruction caches.
