/*  Operation - The destination variable becomes a new alias of the data pointed to by the source container variable:
 *
 *  1) Index into the variable name table to get the variable name for the new alias (destination).
 *  2) Create the hash for the variable and look up in hash table (adding if not yet created).
 *  3) See if hash entry has a value pointer. If yes and same as source var, we are done (NOOP).
 *  4) Set hash entry to point to new lv_val.
 *  5) Whichever symval of source container or the alias it pointed to has the largest address, that symval is the
 *     earliest symval affected by this alias action. Mark all interveening symvals (end points included) as having
 *     had alias activity via MARK_ALIAS_ACTIVE macro. This is so we can properly handle issues in an exlusive NEW
 *     situation involving multiple symvals and potential aliasing between them.
 *
 *  Note that this opcode's function is very similar to "op_setalsctin2als" but is necessarily different because the
 *  source container is in a temporary mval passed back through a function rather than the lv_val that "op_setalsctin2als"
 *  deals with. Consequently, the amount of verification we can do is reduced. But this is acceptable due to the checks
 *  done by "unw_retarg" and "op_exfunretals" which pre-processed this value for us. There is also different reference
 *  count maintenance to do than the "op_setalsctin2als" opcode. With substantially more work to reorganize how SET
 *  operates, it would likely be possible to combine these functions but the way things are structured now, all the
 *  set functions plus "op_sto" share the same API so adding a parm to one means adding a useless parm to all 6 of
 *  them which is not acceptable so we end up duplicating portions of code here.
