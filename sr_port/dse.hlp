1 Operations
   Operations

   The GT.M Database Structure Editor, DSE, is primarily a tool for
   authorized GT.M consultants to examine and, under unusual circumstances,
   repair GT.M Database Structure (GDS) databases. With DSE, it is possible
   to see and change most of the attributes of a GT.M database.

   DSE gives all possible control over a database and therefore, it may cause
   irreparable damage when used without knowing the consequences. Therefore,
   you unless you have extensive experience, you should always get guidance
   from FIS or an equivalently knowledgeable support resource before running
   any DSE command that changes any attribute of any production database or
   other database you value. However, you can use those DSE commands that let
   you see the attributes of your database for collecting database metrics
   and monitoring status.

   GT.M installation procedure places the DSE utility program in a directory
   specified by the environment variable gtm_dist.

   Invoke DSE using the "dse" command at the shell prompt. If this does not
   work, consult your system manager to investigate setup and file access
   issues.

   Example:

   $gtm_dist/dse
   File/usr/name/mumps.dat
   Region  DEFAULT
   DSE>

   DSE displays the DSE> prompt.

   You may also specify a command when entering DSE.

   By default, DSE starts with the region that stands first in the list of
   regions arranged in alphabetical order. In the above example, the first
   region is DEFAULT.

   You may also specify a command when entering DSE.

   Example:

   $gtm_dist/dse dump -fileheader

   This command displays the fileheader of the region that stands first in
   the list of regions arranged in alphabetical order and then returns to the
   shell prompt. To look at other regions, at the DSE prompt you must first
   issue a FIND -REGION=<desired-region> command.

   As previously mentioned, DSE provides control over most of the attributes
   of your database. With DSE, it is possible to examine them and,with a few
   exceptions, change them.

   All DSE commands are divided into two categories-Change commands and
   Inquiry commands. Change commands allow you to modify the attribute of
   your database, in most cases without any warning or error. As the low
   level tool of last resort, Change commands allow you to take certain
   actions that can cause extensive damage when undertaken without an
   extensive understanding of the underlying data structures on disk and in
   memory and with an imperfect understanding of the commands issued. Do not
   use the Change commands unless you know exactly what you are doing and
   have taken steps to protect yourself against mistakes, both inadvertent
   and resulting from an incomplete understanding of the commands you issue.
   Change commands are not required for normal operation, and are usually
   only used under the direction of FIS support to recover from the
   unanticipated consequences of failures not adequately planned for (for
   example, you should configure GT.M applications such that you never need a
   Change command to recover from a system crash).

   Inquiry commands let you see the attributes of your database. You may
   frequently use the inquiry commands for collecting your database metrics
   and status reporting.

   The list of Change commands is as follows:

   AD[D]
   AL[L]
   B[UFFER _FLUSH]
   CH[ANGE]
   CR[ITICAL]
   REM[OVE]
   RES[TORE]
   SH[IFT]
   W[CINIT]
   OV[ERWRITE]
   M[APS] -BU[SY] -F[REE] -M[ASTER] -R[ESTORE_ALL]

   The list of Inquiry commands is as follows:

   CL[OSE]
   D[UMP]
   EV[ALUATE]
   EX[IT]
   F[IND]
   H[ELP]
   I[NTEGRIT]
   M[APS] -BL[OCK]
   OP[EN]
   P[AGE]
   RA[NGE]
   SA[VE]
   SP[AWN]

   Although DSE can operate concurrently with other processes that access the
   same database file, FIS strongly recommends using DSE in standalone mode
   when using Change commands. Some DSE operations can adversely impact the
   database when they occur during active use of the database. Other DSE
   operations may be difficult to perform in a logically sound fashion
   because a DSE operator works on a block at a time, while normal database
   operations update all related blocks almost simultaneously.

   **Caution**

   When DSE attaches to a database with a version that does not match the DSE
   version, DSE issues an informational message and continues. At this point,
   you should exit DSE and find the version of DSE that matches the database.
   You should continue after this warning if and only if you are certain that
   the DSE is indeed from the GT.M version that has the database open (and
   hence the error results from a damaged database file header or shared
   memory that you intend to repair, following instructions from FIS).

   Use the DSE EXIT, or QUIT command to leave DSE.

1 Commands
   Commands

   The general format of DSE commands is:

   command [-qualifier[...]] [object[,...]]

   DSE interprets all numeric input as hexadecimal, except for time values,
   the values for the following qualifiers when used with CHANGE -FILEHEADER:
   -BLK_SIZE=, DECLOCATION=, -KEY_MAX_SIZE=, -RECORD_MAX_SIZE,
   -REFERENCE_COUNT=, -TIMERS_PENDING and -WRITES_PER_FLUSH, and the value
   for -VERSION= when used with the REMOVE and RESTORE commands. These
   conventions correspond to the displays provided by DSE and by MUPIP INTEG.

2 ADD
   ADD

   Adds a record to a block. The format of the ADD command for blocks with a
   level greater than zero (0) is:

   ADD [-B[LOCK]=[block] {-OFFSET=offset|-RECORD=record} -STAR -POINTER=block

   or

   ADD [-B[LOCK]=[block] {-OFFSET=offset|-RECORD=record} -KEY=key -POINTER=pointer

   The format of the ADD command for level 0 blocks is:

   ADD [-B[LOCK]=[block] {-OFFSET=offset|-RECORD=record} -KEY=key -DATA=string

   The ADD command requires either the -OFFSET or -RECORD qualifier to
   position the record in the block, and either the -KEY or the -STAR
   qualifier to define the key for the block.

   The -STAR qualifier is invalid at level 0 (a data block). The ADD command
   requires the -DATA qualifier at level 0 or the -POINTER qualifier at any
   other level to provide record content.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -B[LOCK]=block-number

   Specifies the block to receive the new record.

   On commands with no -BLOCK= qualifier, DSE uses the last block handled by
   a DSE operation. When no block has been accessed, that is, on the first
   block-oriented command, DSE uses block one (1).

   -D[ATA]=string

   Specifies the data field for records added to a data block. Use quotation
   marks around the string and escape codes of the form \a\b, where "a" and
   "b" are hexadecimal digits representing non-printing characters. \\
   translates to a single backslash. \'\' translates to a NULL value.

   Incompatible with: -STAR,-POINTER

   -K[EY]=key

   Specifies the key of the new record. Enclose M-style global references,
   including the leading caret symbol (^), in quotation marks (" ").

   Incompatible with: -STAR

   -O[FFSET]=offset

   Adds the new record at the next record boundary after the specified
   offset.

   Incompatible with: -RECORD, -STAR

   -P[OINTER]=pointer

   Specifies the block pointer field for records added to an index block. The
   -POINTER qualifier cannot be used at level 0. Note this means that to add
   pointers at level 0 of the Directory Tree you must specify a string of
   bytes or temporarily change the block level.

   Incompatible with: -DATA

   -R[ECORD]=record-number

   Specifies a record number of the new record.

   Incompatible with: -OFFSET,-STAR

   -S[TAR]

   Adds a star record (that is, a record that identifies the last record in
   an indexed block) at the end of the specified block. The -STAR qualifier
   cannot be used at level 0.

   Incompatible with: -DATA,-KEY,-OFFSET,-RECORD

3 Examples
   Examples

   DSE>add -block=6F -record=57 -key="^Capital(""Mongolia"")" -data="Ulan Bator"

   This command adds a new record with key ^Capital("Mongolia") at the
   specified location. Note that this command is applicable to level 0 blocks
   only.

   Example:

   DSE>add -star -bl=59A3 -pointer=2

   This command adds a star record in block 59A3. Note that this command is
   applicable to blocks > level 0.

   Example:

   DSE>add -block=3 -record=4 -key="^Fruits(4)" -data="Grapes"

   Suppose your database has 3 global nodes -- ^Fruits(1)="Apple",
   ^Fruits(2)="Banana", and ^Fruits(3)="Cherry", then the above command adds
   a new node ^Fruits(4)="Grapes" at record 4. Note that this command is
   applicable to level 0 blocks only. The interpreted output as a result of
   the above command looks like the following:

   Block 3   Size 4B   Level 0   TN 4 V6
   Rec:1  Blk 3  Off 10  Size 14  Cmpc 0  Key ^Fruits(1)
         10 : | 14  0  0  0 46 72 75 69 74 73  0 BF 11  0  0 41 70 70 6C 65|
              |  .  .  .  .  F  r  u  i  t  s  .  .  .  .  .  A  p  p  l  e|
   Rec:2  Blk 3  Off 24  Size D  Cmpc 8  Key ^Fruits(2)
         24 : |  D  0  8  0 21  0  0 42 61 6E 61 6E 61                     |
              |  .  .  .  .  !  .  .  B  a  n  a  n  a                     |
   Rec:3  Blk 3  Off 31  Size D  Cmpc 8  Key ^Fruits(3)
         31 : |  D  0  8  0 31  0  0 43 68 65 72 72 79                     |
              |  .  .  .  .  1  .  .  C  h  e  r  r  y                     |
   Rec:4  Blk 3  Off 3E  Size D  Cmpc 8  Key ^Fruits(4)
         3E : |  D  0  8  0 41  0  0 47 72 61 70 65 73                     |
              |  .  .  .  .  A  .  .  G  r  a  p  e  s                     |

   Example:

   $dse add -star -bl=1 -pointer=2

   This command adds a star record in block 1. Note that this command is
   applicable to blocks > Level 0.

   Example:

   $ dse add -block=4 -key="^Vegetables" -pointer=7 -offset=10

   This command creates a block with key ^Vegetables pointing to block 7.

   Example:

   DSE> add -record=2 -key="^foo" -data=\'\'

   This example adds a new node (set ^foo="") as the second record of the
   current database block.

2 ALL
   ALL

   Applies action(s) specified by a qualifier to all GDS regions defined by
   the current global directory.

   The format of the ALL command is:

   AL[L]
   [
   -B[UFFER_FLUSH]
   -C[RITINIT]
   -D[UMP] -A[LL]
   -[NO]F[REEZE]
   -O[VERRIDE]]
   -REF[ERENCE]
   -REL[EASE]
   -REN[EW]
   -S[EIZE]
   -W[CINIT]
   ]

     o This is a very powerful command; use it with caution.
     o Be especially careful if you have an overlapping database structure
       (for example, overlapping regions accessed from separate application
       global directories).
     o If you use this type of database structure, you may need to construct
       special Global Directories that exclude overlapped regions to use with
       DSE.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -ALL

   Displays additional information on the database most of which is useful
   for FIS in diagnosing issues.

   Meaningful only with: -D[UMP]

   -BUFFER_FLUSH

   Flushes to disk the file header and all pooled buffers for all regions of
   the current global directory.

   Incompatible with: -RENEW

   -C[RITINIT]

   Initializes critical sections for all regions of the current directory.

   Incompatible with: -RENEW, -RELEASE, -SIEZE

   **Caution**

   Never use CRITINIT while concurrent updates are in progress as doing so
   may damage the database.

   -[D]UMP

   Displays fileheader information.

   Compatible with: -A[LL]

   -[NO]F[REEZE]

   Freezes or prevents updates all regions of the current global directory.

     o The FREEZE qualifier freezes all GDS regions except those previously
       frozen by another process . Regions frozen by a particular process are
       associated with that process .
     o A frozen region may be unfrozen for updates in one of two ways: The
       process which froze the region may unfreeze it with the -NOFREEZE
       qualifier; or another process may override the freeze in conjunction
       with the -OVERRIDE qualifier.
     o By default, the -NOFREEZE qualifier unfreezes only those GDS regions
       that were previously frozen by a process . Once a region is unfrozen,
       it may be updated by any process .To unfreeze all GDS regions of the
       Global Directory, use the -OVERRIDE qualifier.
     o DSE releases any FREEZE it holds when it exits, therefore, use the
       same DSE invocation or SPAWN to perform operations after executing the
       ALL -FREEZE command.

   Incompatible with: -RENEW

   -O[VERRIDE]

   Overrides the ALL -FREEZE or ALL -NOFREEZE operation.

   When used with -NOFREEZE, -OVERRIDE unfreezes all GDS regions, including
   those frozen by other users.

   When used with -FREEZE, -OVERRIDE freezes all GDS regions, including those
   frozen by other processes associating all such freezes with the current
   process. The current process must then use -NOFREEZE to unfreeze the
   database; any other process attempting a -NOFREEZE should also have to
   include the -OVERRIDE qualifier.

   Meaningful only with: [NO]FREEZE

   -REF[ERENCE]

   Resets the reference count field to 1 for all regions of the current
   global directory.

     o A Reference count is a file header element field that tracks how many
       processes are accessing the database with read/write permissions.
     o This qualifier is intended for use when DSE is the only process
       attached to the databases of the curent global directory. Using it
       when there are other users attached produces an incorrect value.

   Incompatible with: -RENEW

   -REL[EASE]

   Releases critical sections for all regions of the current global
   directory.

   Incompatible with: -CRITINIT, -RENEW, -SEIZE

   -REN[EW]

   Reinitializes the critical sections (-CRITICAL) and buffers (-WCINIT),
   resets reference counts (-REFERENCE_COUNT) to 1, and clears freeze
   (-NOFREEZE) for all regions of the current global directory .

     o -RENEW requires confirmation.
     o The RENEW action will cause all current accessors of the affected
       database regions to receive a fatal error on their next access
       attempt.
     o This operation is dangerous, drastic, and a last resort if multiple
       database have hangs that have not yielded to other resolution
       attempts; there is almost never a good reason to use this option.

   -S[EIZE]

   Seizes the critical section for all regions of the current global
   directory. The -SEIZE qualifier is useful when you encounter a
   DSEBLKRDFAIL error, generated when DSE is unable to read a block from the
   database.

   Incompatible with: -RENEW, -RELEASE, -CRITINIT

   -W[CINIT]

   Reinitializes the buffers for all regions of the current global directory.

   -WCINIT requires confirmation.

   **Caution**

   This operation is likely to cause database damage when used while
   concurrent updates are in progress.

   Incompatible with: -RENEW

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> all flush -buffer_flush

   This command flushes the file header and cache buffers to disk for all
   regions.

   Example:

   DSE> ALL -CRITINIT

   This command initializes critical sections for all regions of the current
   directory.

   Example:

   DSE> ALL -FREEZE
   DSE> SPAWN "mumps -dir"

   The first command freezes all regions of the current global directory. The
   second command creates an child (shell) process and executes the "mumps
   -dir" command. Then type S ^A=1 at GTM prompt. Notice that the command
   hangs because of the DSE FREEZE in place.

   Example:

   DSE> ALL -NOFREEZE -OVERRIDE

   This command removes the FREEZE on all current region including the FREEZE
   placed by other users.

   Example:

   DSE> ALL -REFERENCE

   This command sets the reference count field in the file header(s) to 1.

   Example:

   DSE> ALL -RELEASE

   This command releases critical sections owned by the current process for
   all regions of the current global directory.

   Example:

   DSE> ALL -RENEW

   This command reinitializes critical sections, buffers, resets the
   reference count to 1, and clears freeze for all regions of the current
   global directory.

   Example:

   DSE> ALL -SEIZE

   This command seizes all critical sections for all regions of the current
   global directory.

   Example:

   DSE> ALL -WCINIT

   This command reinitializes the buffers for all regions of the current
   global directory.

2 Buffer_flush
   Buffer_flush

   Flushes the file header and the current region's buffers to disk.

   The format of the BUFFER_FLUSH command is:

   B[UFFER_FLUSH]

   The BUFFER_FLUSH command has no qualifiers.

2 CHange
   CHange

   The CHANGE command changes fields of a block, file, or record header.

   The format of the CHANGE command is:

   CH[ANGE]

   The CHANGE command either has a -FILEHEADER qualifier or an implicit or
   explicit -BLOCK qualifier, plus one or more of their associated
   qualifiers, to define the target of the change.

   -BL[OCK]=block-number and one or more of the following qualifiers:

   -BS[IZ]=block-size
   -L[EVEL]=level
   -TN[=transaction-number]
   -OF[FSET]=offset
   -RE[CORD]=record-number
   -CM[PC]=compression-count

3 BLock_Qualifiers
   BLock Qualifiers

   This section describes -BLOCK and all of its qualifiers.

   -BL[OCK]=block_number

   Specifies the block to modify. The -BLOCK qualifier is incompatible with
   the -FILEHEADER qualifier and all qualifiers related to -FILEHEADER.

   -BLOCK is the default qualifier. On commands with neither a -BLOCK nor a
   -FILEHEADER qualifier, DSE uses the last block handled by a DSE operation.
   When no block has been accessed, that is, on the first block-oriented
   command, DSE uses block one (1).

   Incompatible with: -FILEHEADER and qualifiers used with -FILEHEADER

   The following qualifiers operate on a block header.

   -BS[IZ]=block_size

   Changes the block size field of the specified block.

     o block_size is in hexadecimal form.
     o Decreasing the block size can result in loss of existing data.

   **Note**

   The block size must always be less than or equal to the block size in the
   file header.

   Use only with: -BLOCK, -LEVEL, -TN

   -L[EVEL]=level

   Changes the level field for the specified block.

   **Note**

   DSE lets you change the level of a bitmap block to -1 (the value of the
   level for a bitmap block) when the bitmap level gets corrupted and takes
   on an arbitrary value. Note that you should specify -1 in hexadecimal
   form, that is, FF.

   Use only with: -BLOCK, -BSIZ, -TN

   Example:

   DSE >change -level=FF

   -TN[=transaction_number]

   Changes the transaction number for the current block.

     o When a CHANGE command does not include a -TN=, DSE sets the
       transaction number to the current transaction number.
     o Manipulation of the block transaction number affects MUPIP BACKUP
       -BYTESTREAM, and -ONLINE.

   Use only with: -BLOCK, -BSIZ, -LEVEL

   -OF[FSET]=offset

   Specifies the offset, in bytes, of the target record within the block. If
   the offset does not point to the beginning of a record, DSE rounds down to
   the last valid record start (for example, CHANGE -OFFSET=10 starts at
   -OFFSET=A, if that was the last record).

   Use only with: -BLOCK, -CMPC, and -RSIZ.

   -RE[CORD]=record_number

   Specifies the record number of the target record.

   Use only with: -BLOCK, -CMPC, and -RSIZ.

   -CM[PC]=compression_count

   Change the compression count field of the specified record.

     o The compression count specifies the number of bytes at the beginning
       of a key that are common to the previous key in the same block.
     o Because compression counts propagate from the "front" of the block,
       this can potentially change the keys of all records following it in
       the block. If the goal is to change only a single record, it may be
       preferable to add a new record and remove the old one.

   Use only with: -BLOCK, -RECORD, -OFFSET, -RSIZE

   -RS[IZ]=record_size

   Changes the record size field of the specified record.

   **Caution**

   Changing -RSIZ impacts all records following it in the block.

   Use only with: -BLOCK, -RECORD, -CMPC, -OFFSET

   Example:

   DSE> change -record=3 -rsiz=3B -block=2

   This command changes the record size of record 3 block 2 to 59 (Hex: 3B)
   bytes.

3 FIleheader_Qualifiers
   FIleheader Qualifiers

   This section describes the -FILEHEADER qualifier and the other qualifiers
   that operate on a file header.

   -FI[LEHEADER]

   Modifies a file header element that you specify with an associated
   qualifier.

   Incompatible with: -BSIZ, -CMPC, -TN, -LEVEL, -OFFSET, -RECORD, -RSIZ

   -AB[ANDONED_KILLS]=value

   Changes the value of the Abandoned Kills field. The value can be "NONE" or
   a decimal positive integer.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -BLK[_SIZE]=block_size

   Changes the decimal block size field of the current file.

     o DSE does not allow you to change the block size to any arbitrary
       value. It always rounds the block size to the next higher multiple of
       512.
     o Use the CHANGE -BLK_SIZE qualifier only upon receiving instructions
       from FIS and only in conjunction with the -FILEHEADER qualifier. This
       DSE command cannot change the working block size of a database and is
       useful only under very limited and extrordinary circumstances. If you
       need to change the block size on a database file, unload the data with
       MUPIP EXTRACT (or an appropriate alternative), change the global
       directory with GDE to specify the new block size, recreate the
       database with MUPIP CREATE and reload the data with MUPIP LOAD (or
       appropriate alternative).

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -BLO[CKS_FREE]=free blocks

   Changes the hexidecimal free blocks field of the current file.

   Use this to correct a value that MUPIP INTEG reports as needing a
   correction, but note that the "correct" value reported by INTEG may go
   out-of-date with the next update. It may be necessary to calculate a delta
   value from the INTEG report, FREEZE the region with DSE, DUMP the current
   -FILEHEADER value, then apply the delta and CHANGE the -BLOCKS_FREE, and
   finally turn -OFF the FREEZE.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -B[YTESTREAM]=transaction_number

   Changes the transaction number in the file header of the last incremental
   backup to the value specified. Use this qualifier only in conjunction with
   the -FILEHEADER qualifier. For compatibility issues with priot versions,
   this can still be specified as -B_COMPREHENSIVE.

   -D[ATABASE]=transaction_number

   Changes the hexidecimal transaction number in the file header of the last
   comprehensive backup to the value specified. Use this qualifier only in
   conjunction with the -FILEHEADER qualifier. For compatibility issues with
   prior versions, this can still be specified as -B_COMPREHENSIVE.

   -B_R[ECORD]=transaction_number

   Changes the hexidecimal transaction number in the file header field that
   maintains this information about the last -RECORD backup.

   -CO[RRUPT_FILE]=boolean

   Indicates whether or not a region completed a successful recovery with the
   MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER command. Possible values are: T[RUE] or F[ALSE].

   Changing this flag does not correct or cause database damage. When
   CORRUPT_FILE is set to TRUE, the DSE DUMP command displays a message like
   the following:

   %GTM-W-DBFLCORRP, /home/gtmnode1/mumps.dat Header indicates database file is corrupt

   **Caution**

   After a CHANGE -FILEHEADER -CORRUPT=TRUE, the file is unavailable to
   future GT.M access other than DSE. Under normal conditions, there should
   never be a need to change this flag manually. A MUPIP SET
   -PARTIAL_BYPASS_RECOV sets this flag to false.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -COM[MITWAIT_SPIN_COUNT]=value

   Specifies the decimal number of times a GT.M process waiting for control
   of a block to complete a block update should spin before yielding the CPU
   when GT.M runs on SMP machines. When run on a uniprocessor system, GT.M
   ignores this parameter. On SMP systems, when a process needs a critical
   section that another process has, if critical sections are short (as they
   are by design in GT.M), spinning a little with the expectation that the
   process with the critical section will release it shortly provides a way
   to enhance performance at the cost of increased CPU usage. Eventually, a
   process awaiting a critical section yields the CPU if spinning for a
   little does not get it the needed critical section. Note that on heavily
   loaded systems, increasing COMMITWAIT_SPIN_COUNT may not trade off CPU for
   throughput, but may instead degrade both. If you set the
   COMMITWAIT_SPIN_COUNT to 0, the waiting process performs a sequence of
   small sleeps instead of the spins or yields.

   The default value is 16.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -CU[RRENT_TN]=transaction_number

   Changes the hexidecimal current transaction number for the current region.

     o Raising the -CURRENT_TN can correct "block transaction number too
       large" errors
     o This qualifier has implications for MUPIP BACKUP -INCREMENTAL and
       -ONLINE.
     o Used with the -BLOCK qualifier, CURRENT_TN places a transaction number
       in a block header.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -DECLOCATION

   Specifies an offset with the file header. If -VALUE is specified (in
   decimal), GT.M puts it at that location.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -E[NCRYPTION_HASH]

   Changes the hash of the password stored in the database file header if and
   when you change the hash library.

   **Caution**

   An incorrect hash renders the database useless.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -[NO]EPOCHTAPER

   Sets a flag that indicates whether or not epoch tapering should be done.
   The default value is -EPOCHTAPER.

   -FL[USH_TIME][=delta_time]

   Changes the flush_time default interval (in delta_time).

     o The time entered must be between zero and one hour. Input is
       interpreted as decimal.
     o A -FLUSH_TIME with no value resets the -FLUSH_TIME to the default
       value (one second for BG and 30 seconds for MM).
     o The units of delta_time are hours:minutes:seconds:centi-seconds
       (hundredths of a second). For example, to change the flush time
       interval to a second, delta_time would be 00:00:01:00. To change it to
       30 minutes, delta_time would be 00:30:00:00. Valid values for the
       qualifier are one centi-second to one hour.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -FR[EEZE]=value

   Sets availability of the region for update. Possible values are: T[RUE] or
   F[ALSE]. Use to "freeze" (disable database writes) or "unfreeze" the
   database.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   DSE releases -FREEZE when it EXITs. To hold the database(s), CHANGE
   -FILEHEADER -FREEZE=TRUE and then SPAWN to perform other operations.

   -FU[LLY_UPGRADED]=boolean

   Sets a flag that indicates whether or not the database was fully upgraded
   from V4 to V5 database format.. The value is either T[RUE] or F[ALSE].

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -GV[STATSRESET]

   Resets all the database file header global access statistics to 0. Note
   that this erases all statistics previously accumulated in the database
   file header.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -HEXLOCATION

   Specifies a hexadecimal offset with the file header. If -VALUE is
   specified, GT.M puts it at that location.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -INT[ERRUPTED_RECOV]=boolean

   Sets a flag that indicates whether or not a recovery with the MUPIP
   JOURNAL -RECOVER command was interrupted. The value is either T[RUE] or
   F[ALSE].

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -K[EY_MAX_SIZE]=key_max_size

   Changes the decimal value for the maximum allowable key size. Reducing
   KEY_MAX_SIZE can restrict access to existing data and cause GT.M to report
   errors. Do not create incompatible key and record sizes.

   Before permanently changing the key size using DSE, use GDE to check that
   the appropriate Global Directory contains the same key size for the
   region. This prepares for future MUPIP CREATEs and performs a consistency
   check on the key and record size values.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -KI[LL_IN_PROG]=value

   Changes the value of the KILLs in progress field. The value can be "NONE"
   or a positive decimal integer.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -N[ULL_SUBSCRIPTS]=value

   Controls whether GT.M accepts null subscripts in database keys.

     o value can either be T[RUE], F[ALSE], ALWAYS, NEVER, or EXISTING. See
       GDE book for more information on these values of null_subscript.
     o Prohibiting null subscripts can restrict access to existing data and
       cause GT.M to report errors.
     o The default value is never.
     o DSE cannot change the null subscript collation order. Instead, use GDE
       to change the null subscript collation order, MUPIP EXTRACT the
       current content, MUPIP CREATE the database file(s) with the updated
       collation and MUPIP LOAD the content.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -OV[ERRIDE]

   Releases or "steals" a FREEZE owned by another process.

   Use only with: -FREEZE

   -[NO]Q[DBRUNDOWN]

   Sets a flag that indicates whether or not the database is enabled for
   quick rundown. The default value is -NOQDBRUNDOWN.

   -REC[ORD_MAX_SIZE]=record_max_size

   Changes the decimal value for the maximum allowable record size. Use the
   -RECORD_MAX_SIZE qualifier only in conjunction with the -FILEHEADER
   qualifier. Reducing RECORD_MAX_SIZE can restrict access to existing data
   and cause GT.M to report errors. Do not create incompatible key and record
   sizes.

   Before making a permanent change to the records size using DSE, use GDE to
   check that the appropriate Global Directory contains the same record size
   for the region. This prepares for future MUPIP CREATEs and performs a
   consistency check on the key and record size values.

   -REF[ERENCE_COUNT]=reference_count

   Sets a field that tracks how many processes are accessing the database
   with read/write permissions. MUPIP INTEG and DSE use decimal numbers for
   -REFERENCE_COUNT. To accurately determine the proper reference count,
   restrict CHANGE -FILEHEADER -REFERENCE_COUNT to the case where the process
   running DSE has exclusive (standalone) access to the database file. When
   DSE has sole access to a database file the -REFERENCE_COUNT should be one
   (1). This is an informational field and does not have any effect on
   processing.

   -REG[_SEQNO]=sequence-number

   In an LMS environment, this sets the "Region Seqno" field.

   -RESYNC_S[EQNO]=sequence-number

   In an LMS environment, this sets the hexidecimal value of the "Resync
   Seqno" field.

   -RESYNC_T[N]=sequence-number

   In an LMS environment, this sets the hexidecimal value ofthe "Resync
   transaction" field.

   -SPIN_SLEEP_MASK]=hexadecimal-mask

   Changes the hexadecimal Spin sleep time mask that controls the maximum
   time in nanoseconds the process sleeps on a sleep spin; zero (0), the
   default causes the process to just yield to the OS scheduler.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -SLEE[P_SPIN_COUNT]=integer

   Changes the hexadecimal Mutex Sleep Spin Count that controls the number of
   times a process waiting on a shared resource (usually a database) suspends
   its activity after exhausting its Mutex Hard Spin Count and before enquing
   itself to be awakened by a process releasing the resource

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -[NO]STD[NULLCOL]

   Changes the collation of empty string ("NULL") subscripts for the database
   file. Although it is not the default, STDNULLCOLL is required with certain
   other characteristics, and highly recommended in any case. If you change
   this when there are existing "NULL" subscripts the results may be
   problematic. FIS recommends you establish this characteristic with GDE and
   load data with a consistent setting.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -STRM_NUM=stream-number -STRM_R[EG_SEQNO]=str_num's_region_sequence_number

   Changes the hexadecimal values of Stream and its Reg Seqno. Use -STRM_NUM
   and -STRM_REG_SEQNO together as part of the same CHANGE -FILEHEADER
   command.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -TI[MERS_PENDING]=timers_pending

   Sets a field that tracks the decimal number of processes considering a
   timed flush. Proper values are 0, 1, and 2.

   Use the CHANGE -TIMERS_PENDING qualifier only upon receiving instructions
   from FIS.

   Use only with: -FILEHEADER

   -TO[TAL_BLKS]=total_blocks

   Changes the hexidecimal total blocks field of the current file. Use only
   with: -FILEHEADER

   **Caution**

   The total blocks field should always reflect the actual size of the
   database. Change this field only if it no longer reflects the database
   size.

   -TR[IGGER_FLUSH]=trigger_flush

   Sets the decimal value for the triggering threshold, in buffers, for
   flushing the cache-modified queue.

   Use the CHANGE -TRIGGER_FLUSH qualifier only upon receiving instructions
   from FIS, and only in conjunction with the -FILEHEADER qualifier.

   -WR[ITES_PER_FLUSH]=writes_per_flush

   Set the decimal number of block to write in each flush. The default value
   is 7.

   Use only with -FILEHEADER

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> change -block=3 -bsiz=400

   This command changes the size of block 3 to 1024 bytes.

   Example:

   DSE> change -block=4 -tn=10000

   This command changes sets the transaction number to 65536 (Hex: 10000) for
   block 4.

   Example:

   DSE> change -block=2 -record=4 -CMPC=10 -key="^CUS(""Jones,Vic"")"

   This command changes the compression count of the key ^CUS(Jones,Vic) to
   10. It is assumed that the key CUS(Jones,Tom) already exists. The
   following table illustrates how GT.M calculates the value of CMPC in this
   case.

   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |    RECORD KEY    | COMPRESSION COUNT | RESULTING KEY in Record |
   |------------------+-------------------+-------------------------|
   | CUS(Jones,Tom)   | 0                 | CUS(Jones,Tom)          |
   |------------------+-------------------+-------------------------|
   | CUS(Jones,Vic)   | 10                | Vic)                    |
   |------------------+-------------------+-------------------------|
   | CUS(Jones,Sally) | 10                | Sally)                  |
   |------------------+-------------------+-------------------------|
   | CUS(Smith,John)  | 4                 | Smith,John)             |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+

   Example:

   DSE> dump -fileheader

   This command displays fields of the file header.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -blk_siz=2048

   This command changes the block size field of the fileheader to 2048 bytes.
   The block field must always be a multiples of 512 bytes.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -blocks_free=5B

   This command changes the blocks free fields of the file header to 91 (Hex:
   5B). Example:

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -b_record=FF

   This command sets the RECORD backup transaction to FF.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader corrupt_file=FALSE

   This command sets the CORRUPT_FILE field to false.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -current_tn=1001D1BF817

   This command changes the current transaction number to 1100000000023 (Hex:
   1001D1BF817). After you execute this command, subsequent transaction
   numbers will be greater than 1001D1BF817.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -flush_time=00:00:02:00

   This command changes the flush time field of the file header to 2 seconds.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -freeze=true

   This command makes the default region unavailable for updates.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -key_max_size=20

   This command changes the maximum key size to 20. Note that the default max
   key size is 64.

   Example:

   DSE> CHANGE -FILEHEADER -NULL_SUBSCRIPTS="EXISTING"

   This command changes the Null Subscripts field of the file header to
   EXISTING. Note that DSE cannot change the null subscript collation order.
   See GDE book for more information on changing the null subscript
   collation.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -reserved_bytes=8 -record_max_size=496

   This command sets the maximum record size as 496 for the default region.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -reference_count=5

   This command sets the reference count field of the file header to 5.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -timers_pending=2

   This command sets the timers pending field of the file header to 2.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -TOTAL_BLKS=64

   This command sets the total size of the database to 100 (Hex: 64) blocks.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -trigger_flush=1000

   This command sets the Flush Trigger field of the file header to 1000. Note
   the default value of Flush Trigger is 960.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -writes_per_flush=10

   This command changes the number of writes/flush field of the file header
   to 10. Note that the default value for the number of writes/flush is 7.

   Example:

   DSE> change -fileheader -zqgblmod_seqno=FF

   This command changes the ZGBLMOD_SEQNO field to 255(Hex: FF).

2 CAche
   CAche

   Operates on the cache of a database having BG access method. The format of
   the CACHE command is:

   CA[CHE]
   [
   -ALL
   -RE[COVER]
   -SH[OW]
   -VE[RIFY]
   ]

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -RE[COVER] [-ALL]

   Resets the cache of a database having BG access method to a "clean" state.

     o With -ALL specified, DSE includes all region of the current global
       directory for cache recovery.
     o Attempt DSE CACHE -RECOVER only if a DSE CACHE -VERIFY commands
       reports the cache is "NOT clean".

   -SH[OW]

   Displays the cache data structure information. All values are in 8-byte
   hexadecimal form. If the database has encryption turned on, SHOW
   additionally displays an element that gives information about the
   encrypted global buffer section in shared memory.

   -VE[RIFY] [-ALL]

   Verifies the integrity of the cache data structures as well as the
   internal consistency of any GDS blocks in the global buffers of the
   current region.

     o With -ALL specified, DSE performs cache verification on all regions of
       the current global directory.
     o It reports the time, the region and a boolean result indicating
       whether the cache is clean or NOT clean. If you see "NOT clean" in
       report, execute DSE CACHE -RECOVER as soon as possible to reset the
       cache in a clean state.

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> CACHE -VERIFY

   This command checks the integrity of the cache data structures as well as
   the internal consistency of GDS blocks in the global buffers of the
   current region.

   Example:

   DSE> CACHE -VERIFY -ALL
   Time 26-FEB-2011 14:31:30 : Region DEFAULT : Cache verification is clean
   Execute CACHE recover command if Cache verification is "NOT" clean.

   This command reports the state of database cache for all regions.

   Example:

   DSE> CACHE -RECOVER

   This command reinitializes the cache data structures of the current region
   and reverts the cache of a database having BG access to "clean" state.

   Example:

   DSE> CACHE -SHOW
   File    /home/jdoe/node1/areg.dat
   Region  AREG
   Region AREG : Shared_memory       = 0x00002B6845040000
   Region AREG :  node_local         = 0x0000000000000000
   Region AREG :  critical           = 0x0000000000010000
   Region AREG :  shmpool_buffer     = 0x0000000000023000
   Region AREG :  lock_space         = 0x0000000000125000
   Region AREG :  cache_queues_state = 0x000000000012A000
   Region AREG :  cache_que_header   = 0x000000000012A030 : Numelems = 0x00000407 : Elemsize = 0x00000098
   Region AREG :  cache_record       = 0x0000000000150458 : Numelems = 0x00000400 : Elemsize = 0x00000098
   Region AREG :  global_buffer      = 0x0000000000177000 : Numelems = 0x00000400 : Elemsize = 0x00000400
   Region AREG :  db_file_header     = 0x0000000000277000
   Region AREG :  bt_que_header      = 0x00000000002B7000 : Numelems = 0x00000407 : Elemsize = 0x00000040
   Region AREG :  th_base            = 0x00000000002C71D0
   Region AREG :  bt_record          = 0x00000000002C7200 : Numelems = 0x00000400 : Elemsize = 0x00000040
   Region AREG :  shared_memory_size = 0x00000000002D8000
   DSE>

2 CLose
   CLose

   The CLOSE command closes the currently open output file.

   The format of the CLOSE command is:

   CL[OSE]

   The CLOSE command has no qualifiers.

2 CRitical
   CRitical

   Displays and/or modifies the status and contents of the critical section
   for the current region. The format of the CRITICAL command is:

   CR[ITICAL]
   [
   -A[LL]
   -I[NIT]
   -O[WNER]
   -REL[EASE]
   -REM[OVE]
   -RES[ET]
   -S[EIZE]
   ]

     o The critical section field identifies, by its process identification
       number (PID), the process presently managing updates to database.
     o Think of a critical section as a common segment of a train track. Just
       as a train moves through the common segment as quickly as possible,
       the same way a process moves as quickly as possible through any
       critical section so that other processes can use it.
     o By default, the CRITICAL command assumes the -OWNER qualifier, which
       displays the status of the critical section.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -A[LL]

   Display all ids of processes owning critical section from all regions. If
   there are no processes owning critical section in a region, ALL displays
   "the CRIT is currently unowned" message for each region.

   -I[NIT]

   Reinitializes the critical section.

     o The -INIT and -RESET qualifiers together cause all GT.M processes
       actively accessing that database file to signal an error.
     o FIS recommends against using -INIT without the -RESET parameter when
       other processes are actively accessing the region because it risks
       damaging the database.

   Use only with: -RESET

   -O[WNER]

   Displays the ID of the process at the head of the critical section. DSE
   displays a warning message when the current process owns the critical
   section.

   Use alone

   Example:

   DSE> critical -OWNER
   Write critical section is currently unowned

   -REL[EASE]

   Releases the critical section if the process running DSE owns the section.

   Use alone.

   -REM[OVE]

   Terminates any write ownership of the critical section. Use this when the
   critical section is owned by a process that is nonexistent or is known to
   no longer be running a GT.M image.

   Use alone.

   **Caution**

   Using CRITICAL -REMOVE when the write owner of a critical section is an
   active GT.M process may cause structural database damage.

   -RES[ET]

   Displays the number of times the critical section has been through an
   online reinitialization.

   Using -RESET with -INIT causes an error for processes that are attempting
   to get the critical section of the region. Under the guidance of FIS, use
   -RESET -INIT as a way to clear certain types of hangs.

   Use only with: -INIT

   -S[EIZE]

   Seizes the critical section (if available).

     o You can also use SEIZE to temporarily suspend database updates.
     o Subsequently, execute CRITICAL -RELEASE command to restore normal
       operation.

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> critical -OWNER Write critical section owner is process id 4220

   This command displays the ID of the process holding the critical section.
   Note that on catching a process ID on a lightly loaded (or unloaded)
   system (for example, text environment) is like catching lightening in a
   bottle. Therefore, you can artificially hold a critical section using the
   DSE CRIT -SEIZE command in one session and view the owner using a
   different session.

2 Dump
   Dump

   Displays blocks, records, or file headers. DUMP is one of the primary DSE
   examination commands.

   The format of the DUMP command is:

   D[UMP]
   [
   -A[LL]
   -B[LOCK]=block_number
   -C[OUNT]=count
   -F[ILEHEADER]
   -G[LO]
   -G[VSTATS]
   -[NO]C[RIT]
   -[NO]H[EADER]
   -O[FFSET]=offset
   -R[ECORD]=record-number
   -U[PDPROC]
   -Z[WR]
   ]

   Use the error messages reported by MUPIP INTEG to determine what to DUMP
   and examine in the database. DUMP also can transfer records to a
   sequential file for future study and/or for input to MUPIP LOAD (see the
   section on OPEN). The DUMP command requires specification of an object
   using either -BLOCK, -HEADER, -RECORD, or -FILEHEADER.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -A[LL]

   When used with -FILEHEADER, the -A[LL] qualifier displays additional
   information on the database most of which is useful for FIS in diagnosing
   issues. A complete description of all the elements that show up with the
   DSE DUMP -FILEHEADER -ALL command are beyond the scope of this book.

   Meaningful only with: -FILEHEADER

   -B[LOCK]=block-number

   Specifies the starting block of the dump. For commands without an object
   qualifier, DSE uses the last block handled by a DSE operation. When no
   block has been accessed, (that is, on the first block-oriented command),
   DSE uses block one (1).

   Incompatible with: -ALL, -FILEHEADER and -UPDPROC.

   -C[OUNT]=count

   Specifies the number of blocks, block headers, or records to DUMP.

   Incompatible with: -ALL, -FILEHEADER and -UPDPROC.

   -F[ILEHEADER]

   Dumps file header information. A DSE dump of a database file header prints
   a 0x prefix for all fields printed in hexadecimal format. Refer to the
   "Introduction" section for a description of the file header fields.

   Use only with -ALL or -UPDPROC

   -G[LO]

   Dumps the specified record or blocks into the current output file in
   Global Output (GO) format. FIS strongly suggests using -ZWR rather than
   -GLO as the ZWR format handles all possible content values, including some
   that are problematic with -GLO.[The GLO format is not supported for UTF-8
   mode - use the ZWR format with UTF-8 mode.

   Incompatible with: -ALL, -FILEHEADER, -UPDPROC and -ZWR.

   -G[VSTATS]

   Displays the access statistics for global variables and database file(s).

   -NO[CRIT]

   Allows DSE DUMP to work even if another process is holding a critical
   section. Since results in this mode may be inconsistent, it should only be
   used if the critical section mechanism is not operating normally.

   -[NO]H[EADER]

   Specifies whether the dump of the specified blocks or records is
   restricted to, or excludes, headers. -HEADER displays only the header,
   -NOHEADER displays the block or record with the header suppressed. DUMP
   without the -[NO]HEADER qualifier dumps both the block/record and the
   header.

   By default, DUMP displays all information in a block or record.

   Incompatible with: -ALL, -FILEHEADER, -GLO, -UPDPROC and -ZWR.

   -O[FFSET]=offset

   Specifies the offset, in bytes, of the starting record for the dump. If
   the offset does not point to the beginning of a record, DSE rounds down to
   the last valid record start (e.g., DUMP -OFF=10 starts at -OFF=A if that
   was the beginning of the record containing offset 10).

   Incompatible with: -ALL, -FILEHEADER, and -RECORD.

   -R[ECORD]=record_number

   Specifies the record number of the starting record of the dump. If you try
   to dump a record number that is larger than the last actual record in the
   block, a DSE error message provides the number of the last record in the
   block.

   Incompatible with: -ALL, -FILEHEADER, and -OFFSET.

   -U[PDPROC]

   Displays the helper process parameters with the fileheader elements.

   Use only with -FILEHEADER.

   -Z[WR]

   Dumps the specified record or blocks into the current output file in
   ZWRITE (ZWR) format.

   Incompatible with: -ALL, -GLO, -HEADER and -FILEHEADER.

   Note that the certain fileheader elements appear depending on the current
   state of database. For example, if Journaling is not enabled in the
   database, DSE does not display Journal data element fields.

   Example:

   $ dse dump -fileheader -updproc

   This command displays the fileheader elements along with the following
   helper process parameters:

   Upd reserved area [% global buffers]   50  Avg blks read per 100 records                200
   Pre read trigger factor [% upd rsrvd]    50  Upd writer trigger [%flshTrgr]                 33

2 EValuate
   EValuate

   Translates a hexadecimal number to decimal, and vice versa.

   The format of the EVALUATE command is:

   EV[ALUATE]
   [
   -D[ECIMAL]
   -H[EXADECIMAL]
   -N[UMBER]=number
   ]

   The -DECIMAL and -HEXADECIMAL qualifiers specify the input base for the
   number. The -NUMBER qualifier is mandatory. By default, EVALUATE treats
   the number as having a hexadecimal base.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -D[ECIMAL]

   Specifies that the input number has a decimal base.

   Incompatible with: -HEXADECIMAL .

   -H[EXADECIMAL]

   Specifies that the input number has a hexadecimal base.

   Incompatible with: -DECIMAL

   -N[UMBER]=number

   Specifies the number to evaluate. Required.

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> evaluate -number=10 -decimal
   Hex:  A   Dec:  10

   This command displays the hexadecimal equivalent of decimal number 10.

   Example:

   DSE> evaluate -number=10 -hexadecimal
   Hex:  10   Dec:  16

   This command displays the decimal equivalent of hexadecimal 10.

   Example:

   $ dse evaluate -number=10
   Hex:  10   Dec:  16

   This command displays the decimal equivalent of Hexadecimal 10. Note that
   if you do not specify an qualifier with -NAME, then EVALUATE assumes
   Hexadecimal input.

2 EXit
   EXit

   The EXIT command ends a DSE session.

   The format of the EXIT command is:

   EX[IT]

   The EXIT command has no qualifiers.

2 Find
   Find

   Locates a given block or region. The format of the FIND command is:

   F[IND]
   [
   -B[LOCK]=block-number
   -E[XHAUSTIVE]
   -F[REEBLOCK] -H[INT]
   -K[EY]=key
   -[NO]C[RIT]
   -R[EGION][=region]
   -S[IBLINGS]
   ]

     o At the beginning of a DSE session, use the FIND -REGION command to
       select the target region.
     o The FIND command, except when used with the -FREEBLOCK and -REGION
       qualifiers, uses the index tree to locate blocks. FIND can locate
       blocks only within the index tree structure. If you need to locate
       keys independent of their attachment to the tree, use the RANGE
       command.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -B[LOCK]=block_number

   Specifies the block to find.

   On commands without the -BLOCK= qualifier, DSE uses the last block handled
   by a DSE operation. When no block has been accessed, that is, on the first
   block-oriented command, DSE uses block one (1).

   Incompatible with: -KEY, -REGION

   -E[XHAUSTIVE]

   Searches the entire index structure for the desired path or siblings.

     o FIND -EXHAUSTIVE locates blocks that are in the tree but not indexed
       correctly.
     o FIND -EXHAUSTIVE locates all paths to a "doubly allocated" block.

   **Note**

   A doubly allocated block may cause inappropriate mingling of data. As long
   as no KILLs occur, double allocation may not cause permanent loss of
   additional data. However, it may cause the application programs to
   generate errors and/or inappropriate results. When a block is doubly
   allocated, a KILL may remove data outside its proper scope. See
   "Maintaining Database Integrity Chapter" for more information on repairing
   doubly allocated blocks.

   Incompatible with: -KEY, -REGION, -FREEBLOCK

   -F[REEBLOCK]

   Finds the nearest free block to the block specified by -HINT. FREEBLOCK
   accepts bit maps as starting or ending points.

     o The -FREEBLOCK qualifier is incompatible with all other qualifiers
       except -BLOCK and -HINT.
     o The -HINT qualifier is required with the -FREEBLOCK qualifier.
     o FIND -FREEBLOCK relies on the bitmaps to locate its target, so be sure
       to fix any blocks incorrectly marked "FREE" before using this command.
       See MAP -BUSY for more information on fixing incorrectly marked free
       errors.

   Required with -HINT; compatible with -BLOCK and [NO]CRIT.

   -H[INT]=block_number

   Designates the starting point of a -FREEBLOCK search.

   FIND -FREE -HINT locates the "closest" free block to the hint. This
   provides a tool for locating blocks to add to the B-tree, or to hold block
   copies created with SAVE that would otherwise be lost when DSE exits. FIND
   -FREE relies on the bitmaps to locate its target, so be sure to fix any
   blocks incorrectly marked "FREE" before using this command.

   Required with: -FREEBLOCK; compatible with -BLOCK and [NO]CRIT.

   -K[EY]=key

   Searches the database for the block containing the specified key or if the
   key does not exist, the block that would contain it, if it existed.

     o Enclose an M-style key in quotation marks (" "). FIND -KEY is useful
       in locating properly indexed keys. The -KEY qualifier is incompatible
       with all other qualifiers.
     o FIND -KEY= uses the index to locate the level zero (0) block , or data
       block, containing the key. If the key does not exist, it uses the
       index to locate the block in which it would reside. Note that FIND
       only works with the index as currently composed. In other words, it
       cannot FIND the "right" place, only the place pointed to by the index
       at the time the command is issued. These two locations should be, and
       may well be, the same; however, remind yourself to search for,
       understand and take into account all information describing any
       current database integrity issues.
     o DSE accepts ^#t as a valid global name when specifying a key.

   Compatible only with [NO]CRIT.

   -[NO]C[RIT]

   Allows FIND to work even if another process is holding a critical section.

   As results in this mode may be inconsistent, it should only be used if the
   critical section mechanism is not operating normally

   -R[EGION][=region]

   Switches to the named Global Directory region.

   -REGION without a specified region, or -REGION="*", displays all existing
   regions in the database.

   Use Alone.

   -S[IBLINGS]

   Displays the block number of the specified block and its logical siblings
   in hexadecimal format.

   The logical siblings are the blocks, if any, that logically exist to the
   right and left of the given block in the database tree structure.

   Incompatible with: -FREEBLOCK, -HINT, -KEY, -REGION

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> find -exhaustive -block=180
   Directory path
   Path--blk:off
   1:10 2:1E
   Global paths
   Path--blk:off
   6:51 1A4:249 180

   This command locates block 180 by looking through the B-tree index for any
   pointer to the block. This command finds even those blocks that are
   connected to the tree but the first key in the block does not match the
   index path.

   Example:

   DSE> find -free -hint=180
   Next free block is D8F.

   This command locates the "closest" free block to block 180.

   You can use this command as a tool for locating blocks to add to the
   B-tree, or to hold block copies created with SAVE that would otherwise be
   lost when DSE exits.

   Example:

   DSE>find -key="^biggbl(1)"

   This command locates the key ^biggbl(1) in the database.

   Example:

   DSE> find -freeblock -hint=232

   This commands starts to search for free block after block 232.

   Example:

   DSE> FIND -FREEBLOCK -HINT=232 -NOCRIT

   This command searches for freeblocks after block 232 even if another
   process is holding a critical section.

   Example:

   DSE> find -sibling -block=10

   This command operates like FIND -BLOCK; however it reports the numbers of
   the blocks that logically fall before and after block 180 on the same
   level. This command produces an output like the following:

   Left sibling    Current block   Right sibling
           0x0000000F      0x00000010      0x00000011

2 Help
   Help

   The HELP command explains DSE commands. The format of the HELP command is:

   -H[ELP] [help topic]

2 Integrit
   Integrit

   Checks the internal consistency of a single non-bitmap block. INTEGRIT
   reports errors in hexadecimal notation.

   The format of the INTEGRIT command is:

   I[NTEGRIT] -B[LOCK]=block-number

   **Note**

   Unlike MUPIP INTEG, this command only detects errors internal to a block
   and cannot detect errors such as indices incorrectly pointing to another
   block.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -B[LOCK]=block_number

   Specifies the block for DSE to check. On commands with no -BLOCK
   qualifier, DSE uses the last block handled by a DSE operation. When no
   block has been accessed, that is, on the first block-oriented command, DSE
   uses block one (1).

   -NO[CRIT]

   Allows DSE INTEG to work even if another process is holding a critical
   section. Since results in this mode may be inconsistent, it should only be
   used if the critical section mechanism is not operating normally.

2 Maps
   Maps

   Examines or updates bitmaps. The format of the MAPS command is:

   M[APS]
   [
   -BL[OCK]=block-number
   -BU[SY]
   -F[REE]
   -M[ASTER]
   -R[ESTORE_ALL]
   ]

   MAPS can flag blocks as being either -BUSY or -FREE. The -MASTER qualifier
   reflects the current status of a local bitmap back into the master map.
   The -RESTORE_ALL qualifier rebuilds all maps and should be used with
   caution since it can destroy important information.

   By default, MAPS shows the status of the bitmap for the specified block.

3 Qualifiers_for_MAP
   Qualifiers for MAP

   -BL[OCK]=block_number

   Specifies the target block for MAPS. The -BLOCK qualifier is incompatible
   with the -RESTORE_ALL qualifier.

   On commands with no -BLOCK= or -RESTORE_ALL qualifier, DSE uses the last
   block handled by a DSE operation. When no block has been accessed, that
   is, on the first block-oriented command, DSE uses block one (1).

   Incompatible with: -RESTORE_ALL

   -BU[SY]

   Marks the current block as busy in the block's local map and appropriately
   updates the master bitmap. BUSY accepts bit map blocks.

   Compatible only with: -BLOCK

   -F[REE]

   Marks the current block as free in the block's local map and appropriately
   updates the master bitmap.

   Compatible only with: -BLOCK

   -M[ASTER]

   Sets the bit in the master bitmap associated with the current block's
   local map according to whether or not that local map is full. MASTER
   accepts bit map blocks.

   Use only with: -BLOCK.

   -R[ESTORE_ALL]

   Sets all local bitmaps and the master bitmap to reflect the blocks used in
   the database file.

   Use -RESTORE_ALL only if the database contents are known to be correct,
   but a large number of the bitmaps require correction.

   **Caution**

   The -RESTORE_ALL qualifier rebuilds all maps and should be used with a
   great deal of caution as it can destroy important information.

   Use alone.

3 Examples_for_MAPS
   Examples for MAPS

   Example:

   DSE> MAPS -BLOCK=20 -FREE

   This command flags block 20 as free. A sample DSE DUMP output block 0 is
   as follows:

   Block 0  Size 90  Level -1  TN 10B76A V5   Master Status: Free Space
                   Low order                         High order
   Block        0: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block       20: |  :XXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block       40: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block       60: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block       80: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block       A0: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block       C0: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block       E0: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block      100: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block      120: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block      140: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block      160: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block      180: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block      1A0: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block      1C0: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   Block      1E0: |  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXX  |
   'X' == BUSY  '.' == FREE  ':' == REUSABLE  '?' == CORRUPT

   Note that BLOCK 20 is marked as REUSABLE, which means FREE but in need of
   a before-image journal record.

   Example:

   DSE> maps -block=20 -busy

   This command marks block 20 as busy. A sample DSE DUMP output of block 0
   is as follows:

   Block 0  Size 90  Level -1  TN 1 V5   Master Status: Free Space
                   Low order                         High order
   Block        0: |  XXX.....  ........  ........  ........  |
   Block       20: |  X.......  ........  ........  ........  |
   Block       40: |  ........  ........  ........  ........  |
   Block       60: |  ........  ........  ........  ........  |
   Block       80: |  ........  ........  ........  ........  |

   Block      1A0: |  ........  ........  ........  ........  |
   Block      1C0: |  ........  ........  ........  ........  |
   Block      1E0: |  ........  ........  ........  ........  |
   'X' == BUSY  '.' == FREE  ':' == REUSABLE  '?' == CORRUPT

   Note that the BLOCK 20 is marked as BUSY.

2 OPen
   OPen

   Use the OPEN command to open a file for sequential output of global
   variable data. The format of the OPEN command is:

   OP[EN] F[ILE]=file

     o OPEN a file to which you want to "dump" information.
     o If an OPEN command does not have a -FILE qualifier, DSE reports the
       name of the current output file.

3 Qualifiers_for_OPEN
   Qualifiers for OPEN

   -F[ILE]=file-name

   Specifies the file to open.

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> OPEN
   Current output file:  var.out

   This command displays the current output file. In this case, the output
   file is var.out.

   Example:

   DSE> OPEN -FILE=var1.out

   The command OPEN -FILE=var1.out sets the output file to var1.out.

2 OVerwrite
   OVerwrite

   Overwrites the specified string on the given offset in the current block.
   Use extreme caution when using this command.

   The format of the OVERWRITE command is:

   OV[ERWRITE]
   [
   -D[ATA]=string
   -O[FFSET]=offset
   ]

3 Qualifiers_for_OVERWRITE
   Qualifiers for OVERWRITE

   -B[LOCK]=block number

   Directs DSE to OVERWRITE a specific block. If no block number is
   specified, the default is the current block.

   -D[ATA]=string

   Specifies the data to be written. Use quotation marks around the string
   and escape codes of the form \a or \ab, where "a" and "b" are hexadecimal
   digits representing non-printing characters. \\ translates to a single
   backslash.

   -O[FFSET]=offset

   Specifies the offset in the current block where the overwrite should
   begin.

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE>overwrite -block=31 -data="Malvern" -offset=CA

   This command overwrites the data at the specified location.

2 Page
   Page

   Sends one form feed to the output device. Use PAGE to add form feeds to a
   dump file, making the hard copy file easier to read. If you plan to use
   the dump file with MUPIP LOAD, do not use PAGE.

   The format of the PAGE command is:

   P[AGE]

   The PAGE command has no qualifiers.

2 RAnge
   RAnge

   The RANGE command finds all blocks in the database whose first key falls
   in the specified range of keys. The RANGE command may take a very long
   time unless the range specified by -FROM and -TO is small. Use FIND -KEY
   and/or FIND -KEY -EXHAUSTIVE first to quickly determine whether the key
   appears in the index tree.

   The format of the RANGE command is:

   RA[NGE]
   [
   -F[ROM]=block-number
   -T[O]=block-number
   -I[NDEX]
   -LOS[T]
   -[NO]C[RIT]
   -[NO]BU[SY]
   -S[TAR]
   -LOW[ER]=key
   -U[PPER]=key
   ]

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -F[ROM]=block_number

   Specifies a starting block number for the range search. DSE RANGE accept
   bit maps as starting or ending points.

   By default, RANGE starts processing at the beginning of the file.

   -T[O]=block-number

   Specifies an ending block number for the range search. DSE RANGE accept
   bit maps as starting or ending points. By default, RANGE stops processing
   at the end of the file.

   -I[NDEX]

   Restricts a search to index blocks.

   -LOS[T]=block_number

   Restricts a search to blocks not found by a FIND -BLOCK.

   -LOW[ER]=key

   Specifies the lower bound for the key range.

   -[NO]BU[SY]=busy/free

   Restricts a search to either BUSY or FREE blocks.

   -[NO]C[RIT]

   Allows DSE RANGE to work even if another process is holding a critical
   section. Since results in this mode may be inconsistent, it should only be
   used if the critical section mechanism is not operating normally.

   -S[TAR]

   Includes index blocks that contain a single star key.

   -U[PPER]=key

   Specifies the upper bound for the key range.

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> range -lower="^abcdefgh" -upper="^abcdefghi" -from=A -to=CC

   This command searches for a specified keys between block 10 and block 204.
   Note that the range (between FROM and TO) of blocks must be valid blocks
   specified in hexadecimal.

   Example:

   DSE> range -lower="^abcdefgh" -upper="^abcdefghi" -from=A -to=CC -noindex

   This command searches only data blocks for the specified keys between
   block 10 and block 204.

   Example:

   DSE> range -lower="^abcdefgh" -upper="^abcdefghi" -from=A -to=CC -index

   This command searches only index blocks for the specified keys between
   block 10 and block 204.

   Example:

   DSE> range -lower="^abcdefgh" -upper="^abcdefghi" -lost

   This command includes lost blocks while searching for the specified keys
   and reports only blocks which are not currently indexed.

   Example:

   DSE> range -lower="^Fruits(15)" -upper="^Fruits(877)" -from=A -to=F
   Blocks in the specified key range:
   Block: 0000000A Level: 0
   Block: 0000000B Level: 0
   Block: 0000000C Level: 0
   Block: 0000000D Level: 0
   Block: 0000000E Level: 0
   Block: 0000000F Level: 0
   Found 6 blocks

   This command search for keys between ^Fruits(15) and ^Fruits(877).

2 REMove
   REMove

   Removes one or more records or a save buffer.

   The format of the REMOVE command is:

   REM[OVE]
   [
   -B[LOCK]=block-number
   -C[OUNT]=count
   -O[FFSET]=offset
   -R[ECORD]=record-number
   -V[ERSION]=version-number
   ]

   The version number is specified in decimal.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -B[LOCK]=block_number

   Specifies the block associated with the record or buffer being deleted.

   On commands with no -BLOCK= qualifier, DSE uses the last block handled by
   a DSE operation. When no block has been accessed, that is, on the first
   block-oriented command, DSE uses block one (1).

   BLOCK accepts blocks higher than the current database size because they
   deal with set of saved block copies rather than the database and there are
   situations where a saved block may be outside the current database size
   (for example, due to a concurrent MUPIP REORG -TRUNCATE).

   -C[OUNT]=count

   Specifies the number of records to remove.

   By default, REMOVE deletes a single record.

   Incompatible with: -VERSION

   -O[FFSET]=offset

   Specifies the offset (in bytes) of the record to be removed. If the offset
   does not point to the beginning of a record, DSE rounds down to the
   beginning of the record containing the offset (for example, REMOVE -OFF=10
   starts at OFF=A if that was the last prior record boundry).

   Incompatible with: -VERSION, -RECORD

   -R[ECORD]=record_number

   Specifies the number that identifies the record to remove. The -RECORD
   qualifier is incompatible with the -OFFSET and -VERSION qualifiers.

   Incompatible with: -VERSION, -OFFSET

   -V[ERSION]=version_number

   Specifies the version number, in decimal, of the save buffer to remove. If
   there are more than one version of a block, -VERSION is required;
   otherwise REMOVE works on that sole version. -VERSION is incompatible with
   all qualifiers except -BLOCK.

   If there is only one version of the specified -BLOCK= block in the current
   region, DSE REMOVE defaults to that version.

   Use only with: -BLOCK; decimal

2 REStore
   REStore

   The RESTORE command restores saved versions of blocks.

   RES[TORE]
   [
   -B[LOCK]=block-number
   -F[ROM]=from
   -R[EGION]=region
   -V[ERSION]=version-number
   ]

   The version number is specified in decimal.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -B[LOCK]=block_number

   Specifies the block to restore.

   For commands with no -BLOCK= qualifier, DSE uses the last block handled by
   a DSE operation. When no block has been accessed, (i.e., on the first
   block-oriented command), DSE uses block one (1).

   BLOCK accepts blocks higher than the current database size because it deal
   with set of saved block copies rather than the database and there are
   situations where a saved block may be outside the current database size
   (for example, due to a concurrent MUPIP REORG -TRUNCATE).

   -F[ROM]=block_number

   Specifies the block number of the SAVE buffer to restore.

   DSE restores the block specified with -BLOCK qualifier with the block
   specified by the -FROM qualifier. If there is only one version of the
   specified -FROM= block, DSE RESTORE defaults to that version and it always
   restores the original block transaction number.

   By default, RESTORE uses the target block number as the -FROM block
   number.

   -R[EGION]=region

   Specifies the region of the saved buffer to restore.

   By default, RESTORE uses SAVE buffers from the current region.

   -V[ERSION]=version_number

   Specifies the decimal version number of the block to restore. The version
   number is required.

2 SAve
   SAve

   The SAVE command preserves versions of blocks, or displays a listing of
   saved versions for the current DSE session. SAVE can preserve 128
   versions. Saved information is lost when DSE EXITs.

   Use with the RESTORE command to move SAVEd blocks to a permanent location,
   and as a safety feature use SAVE to retain copies of database blocks
   before changing them.

   The format of the SAVE command is:

   SA[VE]
   [
   -B[LOCK]=block-number
   -C[OMMENT]=string
   -L[IST]
   -[NO]C[RIT]
   ]

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -B[LOCK]=block_number

   Specifies the block to restore.

   On commands with no -BLOCK= qualifier, DSE uses the last block handled by
   a DSE operation. When no block has been accessed, that is, on the first
   block-oriented command, DSE uses block one (1).

   -C[OMMENT]=string

   Specifies a comment to save with the block. Enclose the comment in
   quotation marks (" ").

   Incompatible with: -LIST

   -L[IST]

   Lists saved versions of specified blocks. The -LIST qualifier is
   incompatible with the -COMMENT qualifier.

   By default, SAVE -LIST provides a directory of all SAVEd blocks.

   LIST may display blocks higher than the current database size because it
   deals with set of saved block copies rather than the database and there
   are situations where a saved block may be outside the current database
   size (for example, due to a concurrent MUPIP REORG -TRUNCATE);

   Incompatible with: -COMMENT

   -[NO]C[RIT]

   Allows DSE SAVE to work even if another process is holding a critical
   section. Since results in this mode may be inconsistent, it should only be
   used if the critical section mechanism is not operating normally.

2 SHift
   SHift

   Use the SHIFT command to shift data in a block, filling the block with
   zeros, or shortening the block. The format of the SHIFT command is:

   SH[IFT]
   [
   -B[ACKWARD]=b_shift
   -BL[OCK]=block_number
   -F[ORWARD]=f_shift
   -O[FFSET]=offset
   ]

   b_shift must always be less than or equal to offset. This means that DSE
   SHIFT in the backward direction is restricted to the maximum of OFFSET
   number of bytes. This ensures that the shift does not cross block
   boundaries, either intentionally or unintentionally.

3 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   -B[ACKWARD]=shift

   Specifies the number of bytes to shift data in the direction of the block
   header.

   Incompatible with: -FORWARD

   -BL[OCK]=block_number

   Specifies the block number to perform the DSE SHIFT.

   -F[ORWARD]=shift

   Specifies the number of bytes to shift data toward the end of the block.

   Incompatible with: -BACKWARD

   -O[FFSET]=offset

   Specifies the starting offset, in bytes, of the portion of the block to
   shift.

   -SPawn

2 SPawn
   SPawn

   Use the SPAWN command to fork a child process for access to the shell
   without terminating the current DSE environment.

   The format of the SPAWN command is:

   SP[AWN] [shell-command]

     o The SPAWN command accepts an optional command string for execution by
       the spawned sub-process. If the SPAWN has no command string parameter,
       the created sub-process issues a shell prompt and accepts any legal
       shell command. To terminate the sub-process, use the shell logout
       command.
     o The SPAWN command has no qualifiers.
     o DSE SPAWN works with an argument. If the argument contains spaces,
       enclose it with quotes.

   The SPAWN command has no qualifiers.

   DSE SPAWN works with an argument. If the argument contains spaces, enclose
   it with quotes.

3 Examples
   Examples

   Example:

   DSE> SPAWN "mumps -run ^GDE"

   This command suspends a DSE session and executes the shell command mumps
   -run ^GDE.

2 Wcinit
   Wcinit

   Use the WCINIT command to reinitialize the global buffers of the current
   region. Because it cleans out the cache, the WCINIT command should not be
   used except under the guidance of FIS.

   **Caution**

   A WCINIT command issued while normal database operations are in progress
   can cause catastrophic damage to the database.

   The format of the WCINIT command is:

   W[CINIT]

     o The WCINIT command has no qualifiers.
     o When you issue the WCINIT command, DSE issues the CONFIRMATION:
       prompt. You must verify the WCINIT command by responding with "YES."

       If you do not confirm the WCINIT, DSE issues the message:

        No action taken, enter yes at the CONFIRMATION prompt to initialize global buffers.

     o WCINIT operations are more safely performed by MUPIP RUNDOWN. Use this
       command only under instructions from FIS.
