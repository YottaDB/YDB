/* The following defines the write_type for a block that is going to be updated.
 * GDS_WRITE_PLAIN is the default type for most updates.
 * GDS_WRITE_BLOCK_SPLIT is set in case of a block update due to a block split.
 * GDS_WRITE_KILLTN requires a little more explanation.
 *
 * The TP commit logic ("tp_tend") makes use of an optimization referred to as the "indexmod" optimization.
 * This optimization tries to avoid a restart in the case where a TP transaction does a SET to a data block and later finds
 * at TCOMMIT time that the index block which was part of the SET had been updated by a concurrent SET (or a REORG split
 * operation) to a different data block (that also had the same index block as an ancestor) which resulted in a block split
 * causing the index block to be updated. In this case there is no reason to restart. The index block could have been
 * modified by other operations as well (e.g. M-kill, REORG coalesce or swap operations or any DSE command or a block split
 * operation that caused the height of the global variable tree to increase [C9B11-001813]). In these cases, we don't want
 * this optimization to take effect as we can't be sure everything that was relied upon for the TP transaction was still valid.
 * These disallowed operations are generically referred to as "kill" type of operations. This optimization is implemented by
 * having a field "killtn" (name derived from "kill" type of operations) in the bt (block-table) structure for each block.
 * This field is assigned the same value as the "tn" whenever an index block gets updated due to one of the disallowed operations.
 * Otherwise it stays untouched (i.e. killtn <= tn at all times). It is the "killtn" (and not "tn") that is used in the
 * cdb_sc_blkmod validation check in tp_tend if we are validating a index block. Since KILLs, MUPIP REORG and/or DSE operations
 * are usually rare compared to SET activity, most of the cases we expect the indexmod optimization to be in effect and
 * therefore help reduce the # of TP restarts due to index block changes. Note that each SET/GET/KILL operation in TP goes
 * through an intermediate validation routine tp_hist which does the cdb_sc_blkmod validation using "tn" (not "killtn").
 * Only if that passed, do we relax the commit time validation for index blocks.
 *
 * The operations that are not allowed to use this optimization (M-kill, REORG or DSE) are supposed to make sure they
 * set the write_type of the cw-set-element to GDS_WRITE_KILLTN. Failing to do so cause "killtn" in the bt to NOT be uptodate
 * which in turn can cause false validation passes (in the cdb_sc_blkmod check) causing GT.M processes to incorrectly commit
 * when they should not. This can lead to GT.M/application level data integrity errors.
