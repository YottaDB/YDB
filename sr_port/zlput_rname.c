 *      exist on the M stack at the same time.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   duplicated  - Pointer to boolean return flag indicating we duplicated the input routine header and
 *                 related fields.
 *   old_rhead   - The routine header being replaced/checked.
 *
 * How multiple versions of a given routine work:
 *   a. The original routine header needs to stay as it is. The address of this routine header can be in
 *      the linkage tables of multiple routines throughout the system. Those routines making a (new) call
 *	to this routine should get the newest version so the original routine header is modified by
 *	incr_link() to point to the stuff of the newest version.
 *   b. Ditto the label table whose entries are updated by incr_link() to point to the lnrtab of the most
 * 	recent routine.
 *   c. Due to a & b, in order to preserve the old rtnhdr and label table, we make a copy of both of them
 *      updating the routine header to point to the copied label table. This works because the copied label
 *      table still points to the old lnrtab which the copied rtnhdr "inherits" (incr_link() assumes
 * 	zlput_rname() released it but it didn't so the copied rtnhdr "owns" it now).
 *   d. As for the linkage table, that too is "inherited" by the copied rtnhdr. Its resolved addresses
 *      still point to what they used to and its unresolved addresses still have entries on the unresolved
 *	chain so if a new routine resolves, it would fill in the entries of both the latest version of the
 *	given routine as well as the copied version.
 *   e. The copied routine header is set into all M stack frames using the old routine or its predecessors.
 *	When the last user of the copied routine is popped, the copied routine is cleaned and the copied
 *      structures released.
