/* The following macro was gutted in V7+ as dsk_read uses the inline fuction above to adjust block_ids, but does not actually
 * upgrade block_id fileds from 4 to 8 bytes, as managing that as part of the read was deemed to complex and not necessary
 * The macro remains in mur_blocks_free.c as a marker for possible future conversions and the text below retained for guidance
 *
 * See if block needs to be converted to current version. Assume buffer is at least short aligned.
 * Note: csd->fully_upgraded is not derived within the macro but instead passed in as a parameter to ensure whichever
 * function (dsk_read currently) references this does that once and copies the value into a local variable that is used
 * in all further usages. This way multiple usages are guaranteed to see the same value. Using csd->fully_upgraded in
 * each of those cases could cause different values to be seen (since csd can be concurrently updated).
