/* The gvstats record exists in two different versions, which may or may not
 * be identical: gvstats_rec_csd_t & gvstats_rec_t.  They *are* identical
 * up to this point in the statistics definitions.  After this point, if
 * IS_CSD_STATS is not defined, the remaining statistics will *not* be
 * present in gvstats_rec_csd_t.  This is the record which is stored in the
 * database file header.  The effect is that stats in gvstats_rec_t, but not
 * gvstats_rec_csd_t will be displayed, and can be shared and queried by ^%YGBLSTAT
 * but will not be stored after a GT.M process exits.  The rationale for this is
 * twofold: 1) It decreases what is stored in the fileheader, avoiding the need to
 * allocate more space there & 2) the GTM-8863 statistics are snapshots into a
 * running process, and not cumulative values it makes sense to sum & store.
 *
 * As it turns out, the number of statistics created by GTM-8863 has been winnowed
 * to the point that they could be stored without a file header expansion.  To do
 * this, comment out the #ifndef below, or edit gvstats_rec.h
 *
 * The current status is that all stats are in both records.  This avoids the
 * bad user experience of 'write $VIEW("GVSTAT","DEFAULT")' showing something
 * different than "mumps -run %YGBLSTAT".  The trade-off is special code in gvstats_rec.c
 * to avoid storing the stats below (though the header space is still allocated).
