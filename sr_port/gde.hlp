1 Overview
   Overview

   The GT.M Global Directory Editor (GDE) is a utility for creating,
   examining, and modifying a global directory. GDE is a program written in M
   and you can invoke it from the shell with $gtm_dist/mumps -run ^GDE. If
   you invoke it from the shell, GDE returns a status indicating success (0)
   or an issue (non-zero).

   Because GDE is an M program, you can also invoke GDE from a GT.M process
   with DO ^GDE. If you invoke GDE with a DO and modify the map of global
   directly currently opened by that process, you must HALT and restart the
   process for the process to pick up the revised mapping. FIS expects users
   normally run GDE from the shell --$gtm_dist/mumps -run GDE.

   The input to GDE can be a command file. In a production environment, FIS
   recommends using command files to define database configurations and
   putting them under version control.

   **Caution**

   A global directory stores database attributes and mapping rules. Processes
   use mapping rules to determine which database file contains a global
   variable node. MUPIP CREATE uses database attributes to create new
   database file(s). Once MUPIP CREATE applies the database attributes to
   create a database file, GT.M does not use the attributes until the next
   MUPIP CREATE. If you use MUPIP SET (or DSE) to change the attributes of a
   database file, always perform an equivalent change to any global directory
   used for a subsequent MUPIP CREATE. Conversely, if you change attributes
   with GDE, existing database files must be explicitly changed with MUPIP
   SET or DSE.

2 Identifying_the_Current_Global_Directory
   Identifying the Current Global Directory

   At process startup, the environment variable gtmgbldir identifies the
   global directory to the process. M application code can access and change
   the global directory through the $ZGBLDIR intrinsic special variable,
   which is initialized from $gtmgbldir at process startup. M application
   code can also use extended global references with the || or {} syntax.

   Note that $gtmgbldir / $ZGBLDIR are pathnames. If they do not start with a
   "/", then the pathname is relative and GT.M searches for the global
   directory starting in the current working directory.

   To change the Global Directory used by processes, specify a new value for
   gtmgbldir.

   Example:

   $ export gtmgbldir=/home/jdoe/node1/prod.gld

   When you invoke GDE and no Global Directory exists for gtmgbldir, GDE
   creates a minimal default Global Directory that is a starting point or
   template for building global directories for your specific needs.

   To retain the default Global Directory, exit GDE without making any
   changes.

   Example:

   $ export gtmgbldir=/home/jdoe/node1/prod.gld

2 Creating_a_Default_Global_Directory
   Creating a Default Global Directory

   When you invoke GDE and no Global Directory exists for gtmgbldir, GDE
   produces a default Global Directory that contains a minimal set of
   required components and values for database characteristics. It can be
   used for purposes such as development and testing work. A default Global
   Directory also serves as a starting point or template for building custom
   global directories.

   To retain the default Global Directory, quit GDE without making any
   changes.

   Example:

   $ gtmgbldir=/usr/accntg/jones/mumps.gld
   $ export gtmgbldir
   $ $gtm_dist/mumps -dir
   GTM>do ^GDE
   %GDE-I-GDUSEDEFS, Using defaults for Global Directory
   /usr/accntg/jones/mumps.gld
   GDE> EXIT
   %GDE-I-VERIFY, Verification OK
   %GDE-I-GDCREATE, Creating Global Directory file
   /usr/accntg/jones/mumps.gld

2 Mapping_Global_Variables_in_a_Global_Directory
   Mapping Global Variables in a Global Directory

   Mapping is the process of connecting a global variable name or a subtree
   or a subscript range to a database file.

   A complete mapping has the following four components:

     o NAME
     o REGION
     o SEGMENT
     o FILE

   These components may be defined in any order, but the final result must be
   a complete logical path from name to file:

   NAME(s) --> REGION --> SEGMENT --> FILE

   The default Global Directory contains one complete mapping that comprises
   these entries for name, region, segment, and file.

   * --> DEFAULT --> DEFAULT --> mumps.dat
   (NAME) (REGION) (SEGMENT) (FILE)

   The * wildcard identifies all possible global names. Subsequent edits
   create entries for individual global names or name prefixes.

   Regions and segments store information used to control the creation of the
   file. The characteristics stored with the region and segment are passed to
   MUPIP only when creating the database file using the CREATE command, so
   subsequent changes to these characteristics in the Global Directory have
   no effect on an existing database.

   On EXIT, GDE validates the global directory to ensure that every legal
   global variable node maps to exactly one region; that every region has at
   least one global variable node mapping to it and that it maps to exactly
   one segment; that every segment has exactly one region mapping to it; and
   that the attributes for each region and segment are internally consistent.
   GDE will not create a structurally unsound global directory, and will not
   exit until it validates the global directory. Informational messages
   advise you of structural inconsistencies.

   There are five primary sections in a Global Directory:

     o TEMPLATES
     o NAMES
     o REGIONS
     o SEGMENTS
     o MAP

   The function of each section in the Global Directory is described as
   follows:

   TEMPLATES

   This section of the Global Directory provides a default value for every
   database or file parameter passed to GT.M as part of a region or segment
   definition. GDE uses templates to complete a region or segment definition
   where one of these necessary values is not explicitly defined.

   GDE provides initial default values when creating a new Global Directory.
   You can then change any of the values using the appropriate -REGION or
   -SEGMENT qualifiers with the TEMPLATE command.

   NAMES

   An M program sees a monolithic global variable namespace. The NAMES
   section of the Global Directory partitions the namespace so that a global
   name or a global name with a subscript range reside in different database
   files. An M global can reside in one more database file, each database
   file can store many M globals.

   REGIONS

   The REGIONS section lists all of the regions in the Global Directory. Each
   region defines common properties for a set of M global variables or nodes;
   therefore, multiple sets of names from the NAMES section map onto a single
   region.

   You assign these values by specifying the appropriate qualifier when you
   create or modify individual regions. If you do not specify a value for a
   particular parameter, GDE assigns the default value from the TEMPLATES
   section.

   SEGMENTS

   This section of the Global Directory lists currently defined segments.
   While regions specify properties of global variables, segments specify the
   properties of files. There is a one-to-one mapping between regions and
   segments. You assign these values by specifying the appropriate qualifier
   when you create or modify individual segments. If you do not specify a
   value for a particular parameter, GDE assigns the default value from the
   TEMPLATES section.

   MAP

   This section of the Global Directory lists the current mapping of names to
   region to segment to file. In the default Global Directory, there are two
   lines in this section: one specifies the destination for all globals, the
   other one is for M LOCK resources with local variable names. If you add
   any new mapping component definitions (that is, any new names, regions, or
   segments), this section displays the current status of that mapping. Any
   components of the mapping not currently defined display "NONE". Because
   GDE requires all elements of a mapping to be defined, you will not be able
   to EXIT (and save) your Global Directory until you complete all mappings.

2 Global_Directory_Abbreviations
   Global Directory Abbreviations

   GDE uses the following abbreviations to display the output of a global
   directory. The following list show global directory abbreviations with the
   associated qualifiers. For a description of the function of individual
   qualifiers, see "GDE Command Summary".

2 Customizing_a_Global_Directory
   Customizing a Global Directory

   Once you have installed GT.M and verified its operation, create Global
   Directories based on your needs. To create customized Global Directories,
   use the appropriate GDE commands and qualifiers to build each desired
   Global Directory. The GDE commands are described later in this chapter.

   You can also create a text file of GDE commands with a standard text
   editor and process this file with GDE. In a production environment, this
   gives better configuration management than interactive usage with GDE.

3 Adding_a_Journaling_Information_Section
   Adding a Journaling Information Section

   If you select the -JOURNAL option when you ADD or CHANGE a region in a
   Global Directory, the following section is added to your Global Directory
   and displays when you invoke SHOW. The columns provided display the values
   you selected with the journal options, or defaults provided by FIS for any
   options not explicitly defined.

                    *** JOURNALING INFORMATION ***
    Region            Jnl File (def ext: .mjl)  Before Buff      Alloc      Exten   AutoSwitch

1 Using_GDE
   Using GDE

   The default installation procedure places the GDE utility into a directory
   assigned to the environment variable gtm_dist.

   To invoke GDE:

   from within GTM, use the command:

   GTM>do ^GDE

   from the shell, enter:

   $ mumps -r GDE

   GDE displays informational messages like the following, and then the GDE>
   prompt:

   %GDE-I-LOADGD, loading Global Directory file /prod/mumps.gld
   %GDE-I-VERIFY, Verification OK
   GDE>

   If this does not work, contact your system manager to investigate setup
   and file access issues.

   **Note**

   Even when invoked from within GT.M, GDE always uses the gtmgbldir
   environment variable to identify its target

   To leave GDE:

    1. Use the GDE EXIT command to save all changes and return to the caller.

       GDE> EXIT

    2. Use the GDE QUIT command to discard all changes and return to the
       caller. This will not save any changes.

       GDE> QUIT

2 Guidelines_for_Mapping
   Guidelines for Mapping

   This section lists the parameters that apply to defining each component of
   a mapping.

   NAMES

   The NAMES section contains mappings of M global name spaces. More than one
   name space can map to a single region but a single name space can only map
   to one region.

   A name space:

     o Is case sensitive.
     o Must begin with an alphabetic character or a percent sign (%).
     o Can be a discrete "global" name, for example, aaa corresponds to the
       global variable ^aaa.
     o Can be a global name ending with a wild card ("*"), for example, abc*
       represents the set of global nodes which have abc as the starting
       prefix.
     o Can be a subtree of a global name, for example, abc(1) represents a
       subtree of the global ^abc.
     o Can be a subscript range, for example, abc(1:10) represents all nodes
       starting from ^abc(1) up to (but not including) to ^abc(10).
     o A global name can be one to 31 alphanumeric characters. However, the
       combined length of a global and its subscripts is limited to 1,019
       bytes (the maximum key size supported by GT.M). Note that the byte
       length of the subscripted global specification can exceed the maximum
       KeySize specified for its region.
     o Maps to only one region in the Global Directory.

   REGIONS

   The REGIONS section contain mappings of database region. A region is a
   logical structure that holds information about a portion of a database,
   such as key-size and record-size. A key is the internal representation of
   a global variable name. In this chapter the terms global variable name and
   key are used interchangeably. A record refers to a key and its data.

   A Global Directory must have at least one region. A region only maps to a
   single segment. More than one name may map to a region.

   A region name:

     o Can include alphanumerics, dollar signs ($), and underscores ( _ ).
     o Can have from 1 to 31 characters.

   GDE automatically converts region names to uppercase, and uses DEFAULT for
   the default region name.

   SEGMENTS

   The SEGMENTS section contains mappings for segments. A segment defines
   file-related database storage characteristics. A segment must map to a
   single file. A segment can be mapped by only one region.

   GT.M uses a segment to define a physical file and access method for the
   database stored in that file.

   A segment-name:

     o Can include alphanumerics, dollar signs ($), and underscores ( _ )
     o Can have from one to 31 characters

   GDE automatically converts segment names to uppercase. GDE uses DEFAULT
   for the default segment name.

   FILE

   Files are the structures provided by UNIX for the storage and retrieval of
   information. Files used by GT.M must be random-access files resident on
   disk.

   By default, GDE uses the file-name mumps.dat for the DEFAULT segment. GDE
   adds the .dat to the file name when you do not specify an extension. Avoid
   non-graphic and punctuation characters with potential semantic
   significance to the file system in file names as they will produce
   operational difficulties.

3 Example_of_a_Basic_Mapping
   Example of a Basic Mapping

   To complete this procedure, you must have already opened a Global
   Directory.

     o ADD a new global variable name.

       GDE> add -name cus -region=cusreg

       This maps the global name cus to the region cusreg.

     o ADD region cusreg, if it does not exist.

       GDE> add -region cusreg -dynamic=cusseg

       This creates the region cusreg and connects it to the segment cusseg.
       -d[ynamic] is a required qualifier that takes the associated
       segment-name as a value.

     o ADD segment cusreg, if it does not exist, and link it to a file.

       GDE> add -segment cusseg -file=cus.dat

       This creates the segment cusseg and connects it to the file cus.dat.

   To review the information you have added to the Global Directory, use the
   SHOW command.

   To perform a consistency check of the configuration, use the VERIFY
   command.

   To exit the Global Directory and save your changes, use the EXIT command.
   GDE performs an automatic verification. If successful, the mappings and
   database specifications become part of the Global Directory, available for
   access by processes, utilities, and the run-time system.

   Only MUPIP CREATE uses the database specifications; run-time processes and
   other utility functions use only the map.

1 Commands
   Commands

   This section describes GDE commands. GDE allows abbreviations of commands.
   The section describing each command provides the minimum abbreviation for
   that command and a description of any qualifiers that are not
   object-related. The section discussing the object-type describes all the
   associated object-related qualifiers.

   Command Syntax:

   The general format of GDE commands is:

   command [-object-type] [object-name] [-qualifier]

   where:

   -object-type

           Indicates whether the command operates on a -N[AME] space,
           -R[EGION], or -S[EGMENT].

   object-name

           Specifies the name of the N[AME] space, R[EGION], or S[EGMENT].
           Objects of different types may have the same name. Name spaces may
           include the wildcard operator (*) as a suffix.

   -qualifier

           Indicates an object qualifier.

   The format description for each individual command specifies required
   qualifiers for that command.

   The @, EXIT, HELP, LOG, QUIT, SETGD, and SPAWN commands do not use this
   general format. For the applicable format, refer to the section explaining
   each of these commands.

   Comments on command lines start with an exclamation mark (!) and run to
   the end of line.

   **Caution**

   An exclamation mark not enclosed in quotation marks ("")(for example in a
   subscript) causes GDE to ignore the rest of that input line.

2 at-sign
   at-sign

   The @ command executes a GDE command file. Use the @ command to execute
   GDE commands stored in a text file.

   The format of the @ command is:

   @file-name

   The file-name specifies the command file to execute. Use the file-name
   alone for a file in the current working directory or specify the relative
   path or the full path.

   GDE executes each line of the command file as if it were entered at the
   terminal.

   Example:

   GDE> @standard

   This command executes the GDE commands in the file to standard in the
   current working directory. standard should contain GDE commands; comments
   should start with an exclamation mark (!).

2 Add
   Add

   The ADD command inserts a new name, region, or segment into the Global
   Directory.

   The format of the ADD command is one of the following:

   A[DD] -G[BLNAME] global-name [-GBLNAME-qualifier ...]
   A[DD] -N[AME] namespace -R[EGION]=region-name
   A[DD] -R[EGION] region-name -D[YNAMIC]=segment-name [-REGION-qualifier...]
   A[DD] -S[EGMENT] segment-name [-SEGMENT-qualifier...] -F[ILE_NAME]=file-name

   The ADD command requires specification of an object-type and object-name.
   GDE supplies default values from the templates for qualifiers not
   explicitly supplied in the command.

   namespace specifies a global name or a global name with subscript(s) or a
   global name with a subscript range in the form of
   global[[*]|[(from-subscript:[to-subscript])]].

   Name spaces and file-names are case-sensitive; other objects are not
   case-sensitive.

3 Name
   Name

   Maps a namespace to a region in the global directory. The format of the
   ADD -NAME command is:

   A[DD]-N[AME] namespace -R[EGION]=region-name

     o You can map a global and its subtrees to different regions.
     o You can also use colon (:) to map ranges of subscripted names and
       their subtrees to a region. Ranges are closed on the left and open on
       the right side of the colon. For example, add -name PRODAGE(0:10)
       -region DECADE0 maps ^PRODAGE(0) to ^PRODAGE(9), assuming the
       application always uses integer subscripts, to region DECADE0.
     o You can also use $CHAR() and $ZCHAR() to specify unprintable
       characters as subscripts. "" (an empty string) or no value (e.g. 20:
       or :20 or :) specify open-ended ranges, which span, on the left, from
       the first subscript ("") to, on the right, the last possible string.
     o Regions that contain global variables sharing the same unsubscripted
       name that span regions must use standard null collation; attempting to
       use the deprecated original null collation produces an error.

   Example:

   GDE> add    -name IMPL                             -region=OTHERMUMPS  ! Map MUMPS implementations to OTHERMUMPS
   GDE> add    -name IMPL("GT.M")                     -region=MYMUMPS     ! While mapping GT.M to MYMUMPS

   These examples map an entire subtree of a global to a region.

   Example:

   GDE> add    -name PRODAGE(0:10)                    -region=DECADE0     ! Ranges are closed on the left and open on the right
   GDE> add    -name PRODAGE(10:20)                   -region=DECADE1     ! PRODAGE(10) maps to DECADE1
   GDE> add    -name PRODAGE(20:30)                   -region=DECADE2

   This example uses a colon (:) to map ranges of subscripted names and their
   subtrees to a region. Note that ranges are specific numbers or strings -
   GDE does not support wildcards (using "*") in ranges.

   Example:

   GDE> add    -name=PRODAGE(:10)                     -region=DECADE0     ! This line and the next are equivalent
   GDE> add    -name PRODAGE("":10)                   -region=DECADE0     ! numbers up to, but not including, 10
   GDE> add    -name PRODAGE(20:)                     -region=DECADE2     ! 20 thru all numbers (> 20) + strings
   GDE> add    -name PRODAGE(20:"")                   -region=DECADE2     ! same as the add just above

   These examples demonstrate the use of $CHAR() and $ZCHAR() to specify
   unprintable characters; Notice that the arguments are positive integers
   (exponential - E syntax not allowed), and valid code points for $CHAR() or
   in range for $ZCHAR(), both with respect to the current $ZCHSET. Also, ""
   (an empty string) or no value (e.g. 20: or :20 or :) specify open-ended
   ranges, which span, on the left, from the first subscript ("") to, on the
   right, the last possible string.

   Example:

   GDE> add    -name MODELNUM                         -region=NUMERIC
   GDE> add    -name MODELNUM($char(0):)              -region=STRING

   This example map numeric subscripts and strings to separate regions.

   Example:

   GDE> add    -name DIVISION("Europe","a":"m")       -region EUROPEAL
   GDE> add    -name DIVISION("Europe","m":"z")       -region EUROPEM
   GDE> add    -name DIVISION("Australia")            -region AUSTRALIA
   GDE> add    -name DIVISION("USA","South","a":"m")  -region USSAL
   GDE> add    -name DIVISION("USA","South","m":"{")  -region USSMZ
   GDE> add    -name DIVISION("USA","WestCoast")      -region USWC

   This example maps global variables with the same unsubscripted name at
   multiple subscript levels.

   Example:

   GDE> add    -name x                               -region=REG1
   GDE> add    -name x(5)                            -region=REG1
   GDE> add    -name x(5,10:)                        -region=REG2
   GDE> add    -name x(5:20)                         -region=REG2
   GDE> add    -name x(20)                           -region=REG2
   GDE> add    -name x(20,40)                        -region=REG2
   GDE> add    -name x(20,40,50:)                    -region=REG3
   GDE> add    -name x(20,40:)                       -region=REG3
   GDE> add    -name x(20:)                          -region=REG3

   This example performs the following mapping:

     o from ^x, upto but not including ^x(5,10), maps to REG1
     o from ^x(5,10), upto but not including ^x(20,40,50), maps to to REG2
     o from ^x(20,40,50) through the last subscript in ^x maps to REG 3

3 Segment
   Segment

   Maps a segment to a database file. The syntax of the ADD -SEGMENT command
   is:

   A[DD]-S[EGMENT] segment-name [-SEGMENT-qualifier...] -F[ILE_NAME]=file-name

   Example:

   GDE> add -segment temp -file_name=scratch

   This command creates a segment-name TEMP and maps it to the file
   scratch.dat in the current working directory. However, if you were to
   specify scratch as the file-name, in other words, an environment variable,
   each process uses the file using the translation of that environment
   variable at run-time.

3 Region
   Region

   Maps a region to a segment. The syntax of the ADD -REGION command is:

   A[DD]-R[EGION] region-name -D[YNAMIC]=segment-name [-REGION-qualifier...]

3 Gblname
   Gblname

   Provides a mechanism to specify the collation for global variables sharing
   the same unsubscripted name. Specifying a collation is necessary for
   globals that span multiple regions and and use an alternate collation.
   Because the global name EURCentral (described in the Introduction section)
   uses an alternate collation, it requires an entry in the GBLNAME section.
   The format of the ADD -GBLNAME command is:

   A[DD] -G[BLNAME] -C[OLLATION]=collation_number

     o Because string subscripts are subject to collation (the unsubscripted
       portion of a global variable name and numeric subscripts are not), GDE
       needs to know the collation sequence number associated with each
       unsubscripted global variable name. M standard collation (the default)
       has a collation number of zero (0). As a consequence, when you use
       alternative collation(s) (other than 0), the collation transforms must
       be available to GDE in the same way as they are to other GT.M
       components. All of a global (all nodes sharing the same unsubscripted
       global name) must have a single collation, which is implicitly the
       case for globals that do not span multiple regions.
     o Globals that do not span multiple regions and do not have any
       collation characteristics defined in the GBLNAME section of the global
       directory take on the default collation characteristics defined in the
       database region to which they map. On the other hand, globals that
       span multiple regions have their collation implicitly (collation 0),
       or explicitly, established by the GBLNAME section of the global
       directory and cannot adopt a differing collation based on the region
       collation characteristic. Because GT.M determines collation for
       globals spanning multiple regions by the GBLNAME characteristic, which
       cannot change once the database files are created, GDE reports
       collation on many error messages.

   Example:

   GDE> add    -gblname EURCentral -collation=1
   GDE> show   -gblname
            *** GBLNAMES ***
    Global                             Coll  Ver
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    EURCentral                           1    0

2 Change
   Change

   The CHANGE command alters the name-to-region or region-to-segment mapping
   and /or the environment for a region or segment. It may also alter the
   association of a global directory with a replication instance file.

   The format of the CHANGE command is:

   C[HANGE] -G[BLNAME] -C[OLLATION]=collation_number
   C[HANGE] -I[INSTANCE] -F[ILE_NAME=[repl_inst_filename|""]
   C[HANGE] -N[AME] namespace -R[EGION]=new-region
   C[HANGE] -R[EGION] region-name [-REGION-qualifier...]
   C[HANGE] -S[EGMENT] segment-name [-SEGMENT-qualifier...]

   The CHANGE command requires specification of an object-type and
   object-name.

   Once you exit GDE, mapping changes, including Instance mapping, take
   effect for any subsequent image activation (for example, the next RUN or
   the mumps -direct command). Changes to database parameters only take
   effect for new database files created with subsequent MUPIP CREATE
   commands that use the modified Global Directory. Use the MUPIP SET command
   (or in some cases DSE) to change characteristics of existing database
   files.

   Example:

   GDE> change -region master -dynamic=temp -key=100

   This command changes the region master to use the segment temp and
   establishes a maximum KEY_SIZE of 100 characters for the next creation of
   a file for this region. The segment change takes effect the first time the
   system uses the Global Directory after the GDE session EXITs, while the
   KEY_SIZE change takes effect after the next MUPIP CREATE that creates a
   new database file for segment temp.

2 Delete
   Delete

   The DELETE command removes a name, region, or segment from the Global
   Directory. The DELETE command does not delete any actual data. However,
   GT.M does not access database files that do not have mapped global
   variables except through extended references using an alternative global
   directory that does not map to them. Note that GT.M replication does not
   support global updates made with extended references, unless they actually
   map to a database file that is a part of the replicated instance.

   The format of the DELETE command is:

   D[ELETE] -G[BLNAME] global-name
   D[ELETE] -N[AME] namespace
   D[ELETE] -R[EGION] region-name
   D[ELETE] -S[EGMENT] segment-name

   The DELETE command requires specification of an object-type and
   object-name.

   Deleting a name removes the namespace-to-region mapping. Deleting a region
   unmaps all names mapped to the region. Deleting a segment unmaps the
   region mapped to the segment.

   You may map the deleted names to another region or the deleted region to
   another segment using the CHANGE command.

   The default namespace (*) cannot be deleted.

   Example:

   GDE> del -name T*

   This command deletes the explicit mapping of all global names starting
   with the letter "T." This command does not delete any global variables.
   However, it may make preexisting globals starting with the letter "T"
   invisible, at least while using this global directory, because the T*
   global names map to the default namespace going forward.

2 Exit
   Exit

   The EXIT command writes all changes made in the current GDE editing
   session to the Global Directory and terminates the current editing
   session.

   The format of the EXIT command is:

   E[XIT]

   GDE performs a full verification test (VERIFY) on the data. If the
   verification succeeds, GDE writes the new Global Directory to file system
   and issues a verification message.

   If the verification fails, GDE displays a listing of all unverifiable
   mappings and waits for corrections. Make appropriate corrections, or leave
   the Global Directory in its original, unedited state by using the QUIT
   command.

   If you have not made any changes to the Global Directory, GDE does not
   save a new Global Directory unless the original global directory had an
   older format which GDE has automatically upgraded. Note that while GDE
   upgrades older global directories to the current version, there is no
   facility to downgrade global directories to prior versions, so you should
   always save copies of any global directories that might be needed to
   retrieve archival data.

2 Help
   Help

   The HELP command displays online information about GDE commands and
   qualifiers.

   The format of the HELP command is:

   H[ELP] [topic...]

   where topic specifies the GDE command for which you want information. If
   you omit the topic, GDE prompts you for it.

2 LOCks
   LOCks

   The LOCKS command specifies the region into which GT.M maps "local"
   locks(those with resource names not starting with a caret symbol ^). GDE
   maps locks on resource names, starting with a caret symbol, to the
   database region mapped for the global variable name matching the resource
   name.

   The format of the LOCKS command is:

   LOC[KS] -R[EGION]=region-name

   The LOCKS -REGION= qualifier allows specification of a region for local
   locks. By default, GDE maps local locks to the DEFAULT region .

   Example:

   GDE> lock -region=main

   This command maps all locks on resource names that don't start with the
   caret symbol, "^" to the region main.

   **Caution**

   GT.M associates LOCKs for global names with the database region holding
   the corresponding unsubscripted global name. Suppose a global called
   ^EURWest spans multiple regions in multiple global directories, a command
   like LOCK ^EURWest may not work in the same way as it would do if ^EURWest
   did not span multiple regions. Before using a command like LOCK ^EURWest
   where ^EURWest spans multiple regions in multiple directories, ensure that
   the corresponding unsubscripted ^EURWest map to the same region in all the
   global directories. Alternatively, you can use LOCK globalname (with no
   leading up-arrow) and control LOCK interactions with the LOCKS global
   directory characteristic or use transaction processing to eliminate the
   use of LOCKs to protect global access.

2 LOG
   LOG

   The LOG command creates a log file of all GDE commands and displays for
   the current editing session. Because the system places an exclamation
   point (!) (i.e., the comment symbol) before all display lines that are not
   entered by the user. In the log, the log can be used with the @ symbol as
   a command procedure.

   The format of the LOG command is:

   LOG
   LOG -ON[=file-name]
   LOG -OF[F]

   The LOG command, without a qualifier, reports the current status of GDE
   logging. The LOG command displays a message showing whether logging is in
   effect and the specification of the current log file for the GDE session.

   The log facility can be turned on and off using the -ON or -OFF qualifiers
   any time during a GDE session. However, GDE closes the log files only when
   the GDE session ends.

   The -ON qualifier has an optional argument of a file, which must identify
   a legal UNIX file. If LOG -ON has no file-argument, GDE uses the previous
   log file for the editing session. If no log file has previously been
   specified during this editing session, GDE uses the default log file
   GDELOG.LOG.

   Example:

   GDE> log -on="standard.log"

   This command turns on logging of the session and directs the output to
   standard.log.

2 Quit
   Quit

   The QUIT command ends the current editing session without saving any
   changes to the Global Directory. GDE does not update the Global Directory
   file.

   The format of the QUIT command is:

   Q[UIT]

   If the session made changes to the Global Directory, GDE issues a message
   warning that the Global Directory has not been updated.

2 Rename
   Rename

   The RENAME command allows you to change a namespace, the name of a region,
   or the name of a segment.

   The format of the RENAME command is:

   R[ENAME] -G[BLNAME] old-global-name new-global-name
   R[ENAME] -N[AME] old-name new-name
   R[ENAME] -R[EGION] old-region-name new-region-name
   R[ENAME] -S[EGMENT] old-segment-name new-segment-name

   The RENAME command requires specification of an object-type and two
   object-names.

   When renaming a region, GDE transfers all name mappings to the new region.
   When renaming a segment, GDE transfers the region mapping to the new
   segment.

   Example:

   GDE> rename -segment stable table

   This command renames segment stable to table and shifts any region mapped
   to stable so it is mapped to table.

2 SEtgd
   SEtgd

   The SETGD command closes out edits on one Global Directory and opens edits
   on another.

   The format of the SETGD command is:

   SE[TGD] -F[ILE]=file-name [-Q[UIT]]

   The -FILE=file-name specifies a different Global Directory file. When you
   provide a file-name without a full or relative pathname GDE uses the
   current working directory; if the file is missing an extension, then GDE
   defaults the type to .gld.

   The -QUIT qualifier specifies that any changes made to the current Global
   Directory are not written and are lost when you change Global Directories.

   SETGD changes the Global Directory that GDE is editing. If the current
   Global Directory has not been modified, or the -QUIT qualifier appears in
   the command, the change simply occurs. However, if the current Global
   Directory has been modified, GDE verifies the Global Directory, and if the
   verification is successful, writes that Global Directory. If the
   verification is not successful, the SETGD fails.

   Example:

   GDE> SETGD -f="temp"

   This changes the Global Directory being edited to temp. The quotation
   marks around the file name identifies the name of the file unequivocally
   to UNIX. If the -f is the final qualifier on the line, then the quotation
   marks are unnecessary.

2 SHow
   SHow

   The SHOW command displays information contained in the Global Directory
   about names, regions, and segments.

   The format of the SHOW command is:

   SH[OW]
   SH[OW] -A[LL]
   SH[OW] -C[OMMAND] -F[ILE]=[gde-command-file]
   SH[OW] -G[BLNAME]
   SH[OW] -I[NSTANCE]
   SH[OW] -M[AP] [-R[EGION]=region-name]
   SH[OW] -N[AME] [namespace]
   SH[OW] -R[EGION] [region-name]
   SH[OW] -S[EGMENT] [segment-name]
   SH[OW] -T[EMPLATE]

   -COMMAND: Displays GDE commands that recreate the current Global Directory
   state.

   -F[ILE]=gde-command-file: Optionally specifies a file to hold the GDE
   commands produced by -COMMAND. -FILE must must always appear after
   -COMMAND.

   Please consider using command files produced with the SHOW -COMMAND -FILE
   for creating new regions and segments in a global directory as the
   defaults come from the templates. If you inadvertently upgrade a global
   directory, you can use SHOW -COMMAND to create a file of commands that you
   can input to GDE with the prior GT.M release to recreate the prior global
   directory file.

   SHOW -COMMAND displays the GDE commands for creating names, regions, and
   segments of the current global directory state in a target environment.
   However, it does not always include the same template settings (SHOW
   -TEMPLATE) of the current global directory. SHOW -COMMAND creates an
   appropriate set of templates that minimize other adjustments to recreate
   the current global directory. If the current GDE template settings (SHOW
   -TEMPLATE) are important for your application, you need set them again
   after applying the commands from GDE SHOW -COMMAND in the target
   environment.

   **Note**

   When GDE encounters an error while executing the @command-file command, it
   stops processing the command file and returns to the operator prompt,
   which gives the operator the option of compensating for the error. If you
   subsequently issue @command-file command again in the same session for the
   same command-file, GDE resumes processing it at the line after the last
   error.

   -ALL: Displays the entire Global Directory. This qualifier corresponds to
   displaying "all" sections of the SHOW report:

   ***TEMPLATES***, ***NAMES***, ***REGIONS***, ***SEGMENTS***, ***MAP***, ***INSTANCE***.

   By default, SHOW displays -ALL.

   -GBLNAME, -INSTANCE, -MAP, -NAME, -REGION, -SEGMENT, and -TEMPLATE are
   qualifiers that cause GDE to display selected portions of the Global
   Directory as follows:

   -INSTANCE: Displays the current Instance Mapping, if any. This qualifier
   corresponds to the section of the SHOW report titled:

   ***INSTANCE***

   -MAP: Displays the current mapping of all names, regions, segments, and
   files. This qualifier corresponds to the section of the SHOW report titled
   ***MAP***. The output of a SHOW -MAP may be restricted to a particular
   region by specifying a -REGION qualifier with a region name argument.

   -TEMPLATE: Displays the current region and segment templates. This
   qualifier corresponds to the section of the SHOW report titled:

   ***TEMPLATES***

   If you want to print the Global Directory, create a log file by executing
   LOG -ON= before executing the SHOW command. The -LOG command captures all
   the commands entered and output. You can print the log file if you want a
   hard copy record.

   If you want to export the current Global Directory state, create a GDE
   command file with the SHOW -COMMAND -FILE=gde-command-file and run it in
   the target environment.

2 Template
   Template

   The TEMPLATE command maintains a set of -REGION and -SEGMENT qualifier
   values for use as templates when ADDing regions and segments. When an ADD
   command omits qualifiers, GDE uses the template values as defaults.

   GDE maintains a separate set of -SEGMENT qualifier values for each
   ACCESS_METHOD. When GDE modifies the ACCESS_METHOD, it activates the
   appropriate set of TEMPLATEs and sets all unspecified qualifiers to the
   template defaults for the new ACCESS_METHOD. Use the GDE SHOW command to
   display qualifier values for all ACCESS_METHODs.

   The format of the TEMPLATE command is:

   T[EMPLATE] -R[EGION] [-REGION-qualifier...]
   T[EMPLATE] -S[EGMENT] [-SEGMENT-qualifier...]

   The TEMPLATE command requires specification of an object-type.

   Example:

   GDE> template -segment -allocation=200000

   This command modifies the segment template so that any segments ADDed
   after this time produce database files with an ALLOCATION of 200,000 GDS
   blocks.

2 Verify
   Verify

   The VERIFY command validates information entered into the current Global
   Directory. It checks the name-to-region mappings to ensure all names map
   to a region. The VERIFY command checks region-to-segment mappings to
   ensure each region maps to a segment, each segment maps to only one
   region, and the segment maps to a UNIX file. The EXIT command implicitly
   performs a VERIFY -ALL.

   The format of the VERIFY command is:

   V[ERIFY]
   V[ERIFY] -A[LL]
   V[ERIFY] -G[BLNAME]
   V[ERIFY] -M[AP]
   V[ERIFY] -N[AME] [namespace]
   V[ERIFY] -R[EGION] [region-name]
   V[ERIFY] -S[EGMENT] [segment-name]
   V[ERIFY] -T[EMPLATE]

   The object-type is optional. -MAP, -TEMPLATE, and -ALL are special
   qualifiers used as follows:

   -ALL

           Checks all map and template data.

   -MAP

           Checks that all names map to a region, all regions map to a
           segment, and all segments map to a file.

   -TEMPLATE

           Checks that all templates currently are consistent and useable.

   VERIFY with no qualifier, VERIFY -MAP, and VERIFY -ALL each check all
   current information.

   Example:

   GDE> verify -region regis

   This command verifies the region regis.

1 Qualifiers
   Qualifiers

   The -NAME, -REGION, and -SEGMENT qualifiers each have additional
   qualifiers used to further define or specify characteristics of a name,
   region, or segment. For more information, refer to the additional topics.

2 Name_Qualifiers
   Name Qualifiers

   The following -NAME qualifier can be used with the ADD or CHANGE commands.

   -REGION=region-name

   Specifies the name of a region. Region names are not case-sensitive, but
   are represented as uppercase by GDE.

   The minimum length is one alphabetic character.

   The maximum length is 31 alphanumeric characters.

   Example:

   GDE> add -name a* -region=areg

   This command creates the namespace a*, if it does not exist, and maps it
   to the region areg.

2 Region_Qualifiers
   Region Qualifiers

   The following -REGION qualifiers can be used with the ADD, CHANGE, or
   TEMPLATE commands.

   -[NO]AU[TODB]

   Specifies whether GT.M should implicitly create a database file for the
   region if none exists when a process attempts to access it. Because it
   carries lower operational risk and provides better operational control,
   the common practice is to create database files with MUPIP CREATE.
   However, AUTODB may simplify operations when you have scratch or temporary
   databases which are best deleted and recreated as a part of standard
   operation procedures.

   The default is NOAUTODB.

   -C[OLLATION_DEFAULT]=number

   Specifies the number of the collation sequence definition to be used as
   the default for this database file. The number can be any integer from 0
   to 255. The number you assign as a value must match the number of a
   defined collation sequence that resides in the shared library pointed to
   by the environment variable gtm_collate_n. For information on defining
   this environment variable and creating an alternate collation sequence,
   refer to the "Internationalization" chapter in the GT.M Programmer's
   Guide.

   The minimum COLLATION_DEFAULT number is zero, which is the standard M
   collation sequence.

   The maximum COLLATION_DEFAULT number is 255.

   By default, GDE uses zero (0) as the COLLATION_DEFAULT.

   -D[YNAMIC_SEGMENT]=segment-name

   Specifies the name of the segment to which the region is mapped.
   Segment-names are not case-sensitive, but are displayed as uppercase by
   GDE.

   The minimum length is one alphabetic character.

   The maximum length is 31 alphanumeric characters.

   -[NO]EPOCHTAPER

   Tries to minimize epoch duration by reducing the number of buffers to
   flush by GT.M and the file system (via an fsync()) as the epoch
   (time-based or due to a journal file auto-switch) approaches. By default,
   EPOCHTAPER is enabled.

   -[NO]INST[_FREEZE_ON_ERROR]

   Controls whether custom errors in a region should automatically cause an
   Instance Freeze. This qualifier modifies the value of "Inst Freeze on
   Error" file header element.

   -[NO]J[OURNAL][=journal-option-list]

   This qualifier establishes characteristics for the journal file on newly
   created databases.

   -NOJOURNAL specifies that updates to the database file are not journaled.
   -NOJOURNAL does not accept an argument assignment.

   -JOURNAL specifies that journaling is allowed. -JOURNAL takes one or more
   arguments in a journal-option-list. The journal-option-list contains
   keywords separated with commas (,) enclosed in parentheses ( ) with
   file-names quoted (for example, change -region test
   -journal=(before,file="foo") . If the list contains only one keyword, the
   parentheses and quotes are optional.

   Although you do not have to establish the criteria for your journaling
   process at this point, it is efficient to do so, even if you are not
   entirely sure you will use journaling. The options available for -JOURNAL
   set up the environment, so it is ready for you to enable with MUPIP SET
   -JOURNAL. You can also change or add any of the established options at
   that time.

   The journal-option-list includes:

     * A[LLOCATION]=blocks

     * AUTOSWITCHLIMIT=blocks

     * [NO]BE[FORE_IMAGE]
     * BU[FFER_SIZE]=pages
     * E[XTENSION]=blocks
     * F[ILE_NAME]=file-specification-name

   The following section describes some -JOURNAL options.

   -AU[TOSWITCHLIMIT]=blocks

   Specifies the limit on the size of a journal file. When the journal file
   size reaches the limit, GT.M automatically switches to a new journal file
   with a back-pointer to the prior journal file.

   -[NO]BE[FORE_IMAGE]

   [NO]BEFORE_IMAGE controls whether the journal should include before-image
   records.

   The BEFORE_IMAGE option is required if you plan to consider "roll-back"
   (Backward) recovery of the associated database file or if you plan to use
   certain database replication options.

   -F[ILE_NAME]="file-name"

   Specifies the name of the journal file.

   Unless the name is the sole journaling option, and is the last parameter
   on the line, it should always be enclosed in quotation marks in this
   context.

   Journal file-specifications-names are limited to 255 characters.

   By default, GDE derives the file-specification-name from the database
   "file-name".

   By default, GDE uses a journal file extension of .mjl.

   Journal Options Summary

   With GDE, you can create the journal files and define the journal
   parameters; however, you must use MUPIP SET to explicitly turn it ON, and
   you must specify BEFORE/NOBEFORE at that time.

   Example:

   CHANGE -REGION DEFAULT -JOURNAL=(ALLOCATION=2048,AUTOSWITCHLIMIT=8386560,BEFORE_IMAGE,BUFFER_SIZE=2312,EXTENSION=2048)

   Summary

   -K[EY_SIZE]=size in bytes

   Specifies the maximum size of keys, in bytes, which can be stored in the
   region. The KEY_SIZE must be less than the RECORD_SIZE. GDE rejects the
   command if the KEY_SIZE is inappropriate for the RECORD_SIZE.

   The minimum KEY_SIZE is three bytes.

   The maximum KEY_SIZE is 1,019 bytes.

   When determining the maximum key size, applications should consider the
   following:

     * GT.M uses packed decimal representation for numeric subscripts which
       may be larger or smaller than the original representation.
     * GT.M substitutes an element terminator for the caret (^), any comma
       (,), and any right parenthesis ()).
     * GT.M adds an extra byte for every string element, including the global
       name.

   For example, the key ^ACN ("Name", "Type") internally occupies 17 bytes.

   By default, GDE uses a KEY_SIZE of 64 bytes

   -[NO]L[OCK_CRIT]

   Specifies whether GT.M should share the resource management between a
   database and its corresponding LOCKs or use separate and different
   resource management for the two. Because, in the current implementation,
   FIS has not identified any reason to share resource management between
   LOCKs and database actions, we have no recommendations other than to
   choose what seems to work better for your application.

   By default, GDE uses NOLOCK_CRIT-Sep(arate) resource management for LOCKs
   and database actions.

   -[NO]N[ULL_SUBSCRIPTS]=[ALWAYS|NEVER|EXISTING]

   Indicates whether GT.M allows null subscripts for global variables stored
   in the region (that is, whether GT.M permits references such as
   ^aaa("",1)).

   ALWAYS indicates that the null subscripts for global variables are
   allowed.

   NEVER indicates that null subscripts for global variables are not allowed.

   EXISTING indicates that null subscripts for global variable can be
   accessed and updated, but not created anew.

   By default, regions have -NULL_SUBSCRIPTS=NEVER.

   -[NO]Q[DBRUNDOWN]

   Shortens normal process shutdown when a large number of processes
   accessing a database file need to shutdown almost simultaneously, for
   example, in benchmarking scenarios or emergencies.

   When a terminating GT.M process observes that a large number of processes
   are attached to a database file and QDBRUNDOWN is enabled, it bypasses
   checking whether it is the last process accessing the database. Such a
   check occurs in a critical section and bypassing it also bypasses the
   usual RUNDOWN actions which accelerates process shutdown removing a
   possible impediment to process startup. By default, QDBRUNDOWN is
   disabled.

   Note that with QDBRUNDOWN there is a possibility that the last process to
   exit might leave the database shared memory and IPC resources in need of
   cleanup. Except after the number of concurrent processes exceeds 32Ki,
   QDBRUNDOWN minimizes the prossibility of abandoned resources, but it
   cannot eliminate it. When using QDBRUNDOWN, use an explicit MUPIP RUNDOWN
   of the database file after the last process exits, to ensure the cleanup
   of database shared memory and IPC resources; not doing so risk database
   damage.

   When a database has QDBRUNDOWN enabled, if the number of attached
   processes ever exceeds 32Ki, GT.M stops tracking the number of attached
   processes, which means that it cannot recognize when the number reaches
   zero (0) and the shared resources can be released. The process that
   detects this event issues a NOMORESEMCNT in the system log. This means an
   orderly, safe shutdown requires a MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -BACKWARD for
   replicated databases, a MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER -BACKWARD for unreplicated
   journaled databases and a MUPIP RUNDOWN for journal-free databases.

   -R[ECORD_SIZE]=size in bytes

   Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of a global variable node's value
   that can be stored in a region.

   If the size of a global exceeds one database block, GT.M implicitly spans
   that global across multiple database blocks. In the event a global
   variable node spans multiple blocks, and the process is not already within
   a TP transaction, the GT.M run-time system automatically and transparently
   performs the entire operation within an implicit TP transaction (as it
   does for Triggers).

   The minimum RECORD_SIZE is zero. A RECORD_SIZE of zero only allows a
   global variable node that does not have a value. A typical use of a global
   variable node with RECORD_SIZE of zero is for creating indices (where the
   presence of a node is all that is required).

   The maximum RECORD_SIZE is 1,048,576 bytes (1MiB).

   By default, GDE uses a RECORD_SIZE of 256 bytes.

   -[NO][STA[TS]

   Specifies whether GT.M should permit processes to share their database
   access statistics for other processes to monitor. There may be operational
   or security reasons to prohibit sharing of statistics. For example, GT.M
   does not share statistics on database files that exist solely to support
   GT.M features.

   By default, GDE uses STATS.

   -[NO]STD[NULLCOLL]

   Determines whether GT.M null subscripts collate in conformance to the M
   standard.

   If STDNULLCOLL is specified, subscripts of globals in the database follow
   the M standard where the null subscript collates before all other
   subscripts.

   If NOSTDNULLCOLL is specified, null subscripts collate between numeric and
   string subscripts. FIS strongly recommends that you use STDNULL and
   against using this non-standard null collation, which is the default for
   historical reasons.

   The following table summarizes GDE region qualifiers. It provides their
   abbreviations, defaults (as provided by FIS), and allowable minimum and
   maximum values.

2 Segment_Qualifiers
   Segment Qualifiers

   The following -SEGMENT qualifiers can be used with the ADD, CHANGE, or
   TEMPLATE commands.

   -AC[CESS_METHOD]=code

   Specifies the access method or the GT.M buffering strategy for storing and
   retrieving data from the global database file.

     o code can have 2 values - Buffered Global (BG) or Memory Mapped (MM).
       The default value is BG.
     o With BG, the global buffer pool manages the buffers (the OS/file
       system may also provide additional buffering). You get the choice of
       using BEFORE_IMAGE or NOBEFORE_IMAGE journaling for your database.

          * BG supports both forward and backward recovery and rollback to
            recover a database without a restore.
          * BG is a likely choice when you need faster recovery times from
            system failures.

     o With MM, GT.M bypasses the global buffer pool and relies entirely on
       the OS/file system to manage the data traffic between memory and disk.
       GT.M has no control over the timing of disk updates, therefore there
       is a greater reliance on the OS/file system for database performance.

          * MM supports NOBEFORE_IMAGE journaling only. GT.M issues an error
            if you use MM with BEFORE_IMAGE Journaling. MM supports MUPIP
            JOURNAL -RECOVER -FORWARD and MUPIP JOURNAL -ROLLBACK -FORWARD.
            With MM, MUPIP JOURNAL -RECOVER -BACKWARD only generates lost and
            broken transaction files but cannot recover the database.
          * Depending on your file system, MM may be an option when you need
            performance advantage in situations where the above restrictions
            are acceptable.

     o GDE maintains a separate set of segment qualifier values for each
       ACCESS_METHOD.
     o When GDE modifies the ACCESS_METHOD, it activates the appropriate set
       of TEMPLATEs and sets all unspecified qualifiers to the default values
       of the new ACCESS_METHOD.

   Example:

   GDE> change -segment DEFAULT -access_method=MM

   This command sets MM as the access method or the GT.M buffering strategy
   for storing and retrieving database for segment DEFAULT.

   -AL[LOCATION]=blocks

   Specifies the number of blocks GT.M allocates to a disk file when MUPIP
   creates the file. For GDS files, the number of bytes allocated is the size
   of the database file header plus the ALLOCATION size times the BLOCK_SIZE.

     * The minimum ALLOCATION is 10 blocks.
     * The maximum ALLOCATION is 1,040,187,392 blocks.
     * By default, GDE uses an ALLOCATION of 100 blocks.
     * The maximum size of a database file is 1,040,187,392(992Mi) blocks.
     * The default ALLOCATION was chosen for initial development and
       experimentation with GT.M. Because file fragmentation impairs
       performance, make the initial allocation for production files and
       large projects large enough to hold the anticipated contents of the
       file for a length of time consistent with your UNIX file
       reorganization schedule.

   --[NO]AS[YNCIO]

   Determines whether an access method BG database file uses asynchronous I/O
   rather than using synchronous I/O through the file system cache.

   The performance characteristics of asynchronous IO are likely to be quite
   different from the traditional sequential IO. Although asynchronous IO in
   theory should be more efficient than synchronous IO by eliminating the
   need for the UNIX file buffer cache and eliminating certain filesystem
   locks, in practice asynchronous IO is likely to emerge from the starting
   gate under-performing synchronous IO because of the years that synchronous
   IO has been the common IO model operating systems and filesystems have had
   used by applications. So, you should anticipate extensive benchmarking and
   tuning for your application to achieve the best performance it can with
   asynchronous IO. Some notes and observations that we have to share:

     o As asynchronous IO dispenses with the UNIX file buffer cache, GT.M
       global buffers are the sole caching mechanism. To make asynchronous IO
       perform well, you will likely need to increase the number of global
       buffers considerably. With GT.M's limit of 2GiB per shared memory
       segment, a database segment with 4KiB blocks has a limit of almost two
       million global buffers.
     o A large number of global buffers potentially implies a large number of
       dirty global buffers to be flushed at an epoch. You should investigate
       the impact on application response time of GT.M epoch tapering vs.
       turning off epoch tapering and using a separate stand-alone process
       that executes a line of code such as: for set x="" for set
       x=$view("gvnext",x) quit:""=x view "dbflush":x,"dbsync":x,"epoch":x
       hang n where n is a number that causes each region to be flushed at an
       appropriate interval. If you choose this option, remember to turn off
       epoch tapering, and to set the epoch interval in the file header to be
       large enough to prevent application processes from performing epochs,
       and consider scripted timely switching of journal files by other than
       application processes (switching journal files involves an epoch).
     o On AIX, consider mounting file systems with the CIO mount option. The
       CIO mount option drops support for the file buffer cache (unused by
       asynchronous IO), and also eliminates a lock that is a potential
       bottleneck to GT.M performance on the AIX jfs2 filesystem.
     o For Linux x86_64, the gtm_aio_nr_events environment variable controls
       the number of structures a process has per global directory to manage
       asynchronous writes, and therefore determines the number of concurrent
       writes a process can manage across all regions within a global
       directory. If not specified, the value controlled by gtm_aio_nr_events
       defaults to 128. If a process encounters a situation where it needs to
       perform an asynchronous write, but has no available slots with which
       to manage an additional one, it either falls back to synchronous
       writing if the write is blocking other actions, and otherwise defers
       the write until a slot becomes available as other writes complete.
       Linux allocates the structures on a system-wide basis with the setting
       of /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr. Therefore you should configure this
       parameter to account for the needs (as determined by gtm_aio_nr_events
       or the default) of all processes using asynchronous I/O. When
       processes use multiple global directories with asynchronous I/O, their
       need for the system resources increases accordingly. For example, if
       an environment runs 10,000 processes each of which open two global
       directories and /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr is set to a value of 200,000
       then gtm_aio_nr_events needs to be set to a value <= 200,000 / (10,000
       * 2) = 10. Conversely if gtm_aio_nr_events is set to a value of 20,
       then aio-max-nr needs to be bumped up to (10,000 * 2 * 20) = 400,000.
       GT.M captures the number of errors encountered when attempting to
       write database blocks for a region, and, barring problems with the
       storage subsystem, hitting an asynchronous write limit would
       constitute primary (probably only) contribution to that value, which
       you can access with the following:

       $$^%PEEKBYNAME("sgmnt_data.wcs_wterror_invoked_cntr",<region>)

     o Limited experience with solid-state storage (SSDs) on Linux in the
       GT.M development environment suggests a considerable difference in
       asynchronous IO performance on the same underlying hardware, with f2fs
       performing better than xfs, which in turn performed better than ext4.

   In GT.M development, we have not benchmarked asynchronous IO on the types
   of storage commonly used for enterprise scale applications (as workloads
   vary widely, we do not routinely benchmark workloads in development).
   Please consider the above observations in this light.

   By default GDE uses NOASYNCIO. On segments with an access method of MM,
   GT.M ignores this setting.

   -BL[OCK_SIZE]=size

   Specifies the size, in bytes, of each database block in the file system.
   The BLOCK_SIZE must be a multiple of 512. If the BLOCK_SIZE is not a
   multiple of 512, GDE rounds up the BLOCK_SIZE to the next highest multiple
   of 512 and issues a warning message.

   If the specified BLOCK_SIZE is less than the minimum, GDE uses the minimum
   BLOCK_SIZE. If the specified BLOCK_SIZE is greater than the maximum, GDE
   issues an error message.

   A BLOCK_SIZE that is equal to the page size used by your UNIX
   implementation serves well for most applications, and is a good starting
   point.

   You should determine the block sizes for your application through
   performance timing and benchmarking. In general, larger block sizes are
   more efficient from the perspective of the input/output subsystem.
   However, larger block sizes use more system resources (CPU and shared
   memory) and may increase collision and retry rates for transaction
   processing.

   **Note**

   Global nodes that span blocks incur some overhead and optimum application
   performance is likely to be obtained from a BLOCK_SIZE that accommodates
   the majority of nodes within a single block. If you adjust the BLOCK_SIZE,
   you should also adjust GLOBAL_BUFFER_COUNT.

   GDE does not allow you to change the block size to an arbitrary number. It
   always rounds the block size to the next higher multiple of 512, because
   the database block size must always be a multiple of 512.

   The minimum BLOCK_SIZE is 512 bytes.

   The maximum BLOCK_SIZE is 65,024 bytes.

   **Note**

   FIS recommends against using databases with block sizes larger than 16KiB.
   If a specific global variable has records that have large record sizes,
   FIS recommends placing that global variable in a file by itself with large
   block sizes and using more appropriate block sizes for other global
   variables. 4KiB and 8KiB are popular database block sizes.

   By default, GDE uses a BLOCK_SIZE of 1024 bytes.

   --[NO]DEFER_ALLOCATE

   Determines whether MUPIP CREATE preallocates blocks on database creation,
   and determines whether subsequent extensions also preallocate. The default
   is DEFER_ALLOCATE. This provides an option to preallocate blocks from the
   file system when creating or extending a database file; by default UNIX
   file systems, and GT.M, use sparse (or lazy) allocation, which defers
   actual allocation until blocks are first written. Failures to preallocate
   space produce a PREALLOCATEFAIL error.

   -[NO]ENcryption

   Specifies whether or not the database file for a segment is flagged for
   encryption. Note that MUPIP CREATE acquires an encryption key for this
   file and puts a cryptographic hash of the key in the database file header.

   -EX[TENSION_COUNT]=blocks

   Specifies the number of extra GDS blocks of disk space by which the file
   should extend. The extend amount is interpreted as the number of usable
   GDS blocks to create with the extension. To calculate the number of host
   operating system blocks added with each extension, multiply the number of
   GDS blocks by (GDS BLOCK_SIZE/host BLOCK_SIZE); add one local bitmap block
   for each 512 blocks added in each extension to the amount from step 1. If
   the extension is not a multiple of 512, remember to roundup when figuring
   the number of bitmap blocks.

   When a MUPIP EXTEND command does not include a -BLOCKS= qualifier, EXTEND
   uses the extension size in the database header.

   The extension amount may be changed with the MUPIP SET command.

   The minimum EXTENSION is zero blocks.

   When a database file with automatic extension disabled (EXTENSION_COUNT=0)
   starts to get full, GT.M records the FREEBLSLOW warning in the system log.
   So as to not compromise performance, GT.M checks whenever the master bit
   map must be updated to show that a local bit map is full, and issues the
   warning if there are fewer than 512 free blocks or if the number of free
   blocks is less than total blocks/32. This means that for databases whose
   size is 512 blocks or less the warning comes at the last successful update
   before the database becomes full.

   The maximum EXTENSION is 65,535 blocks.

   By default, GDE uses an EXTENSION of 100 blocks.

   Like allocation, the default extension amount was chosen for initial
   development and experimentation. Use larger extensions for larger actual
   applications. Because multiple file extensions adversely affect
   performance, set up extensions appropriate to the file allocation.

   -F[ILE_NAME]=file-name

   Specifies the file for a segment.

   The maximum file name length is 255 characters.

   By default, GDE uses a file-name of mumps followed by the default
   extension, which is .dat. You can specify any filename and extension of
   your choice for a database file as long as it is valid on your operating
   system.

   -G[LOBAL_BUFFER_COUNT]=size

   Specifies the number of global buffers for a file. Global buffers reside
   in shared memory and are part of the database caching mechanisms. Global
   buffers do not apply to MM databases.

   Choose the settings for this qualifier carefully. Small numbers of global
   buffers tend to throttle database performance. However, if your system has
   limited memory and the database file traffic is not heavy enough to hold
   the cache in RAM, increasing GLOBAL_BUFFER_COUNT may trigger paging.

   If database global buffers are paged out, it will result in poor
   performance. Therefore, do not increase this factor to a large value
   without careful observation.

   The proper number of GLOBAL_BUFFERs depends on the application and the
   amount of primary memory available on the system. Most production
   databases exhibit a direct relationship between the number of
   GLOBAL_BUFFERs and performance. However, the relationship is not linear,
   but asymptotic, so that increases past some point have progressively less
   benefit. This point of diminishing returns depends on the application. For
   most applications, FIS expects the optimum number of GLOBAL_BUFFERs to be
   between 1K and 64K.

   Because transaction processing can be involved in an update and a
   transaction is limited to half the GLOBAL_BUFFER_COUNT, the value for
   GLOBAL_BUFFER_COUNT should therefore be at least 32 plus twice the number
   of the blocks required by the largest global variable node in your
   application.

   Generally, you should increase the number of GLOBAL_BUFFERs for production
   GDS database files. This is because GT.M uses the shared memory database
   cache associated with each GDS file for the majority of caching.

   The minimum GLOBAL_BUFFER_COUNT for BG is 64 blocks.

   The maximum for GLOBAL_BUFFER_COUNT for BG is 2,147,483,647 blocks, but
   may vary depending on your platform.

   By default, GDE uses a GLOBAL_BUFFER_COUNT that is appropriate for initial
   development use on each platform, but probably too small for production
   applications.

   **Note**

   If global buffers are "paged out," improvements in system performance
   resulting from more global buffers will be more than offset by the
   dramatic slowdown that results from globals buffers that are "paged out."

   Out of the requested allocation, GT.M always reserves 32 global buffers
   for BG access method for read-only use to ensure that non-dirty global
   buffers are always available.

   -L[OCK_SPACE]=integer

   Specifies the number of pages of space to use for the lock database stored
   with this segment. The size of a page is always 512 bytes.

   As GT.M runs out of space to store LOCK control information, LOCKs become
   progressively less efficient. If a single process consumes all the LOCK
   space, it cannot continue, and any other processes cannot proceed using
   LOCKs.

   The minimum LOCK_SPACE is 10 pages.

   The maximum LOCK_SPACE is 262144 pages.

   By default, GDE uses a LOCK_SPACE of 40 pages.

   LOCK_SPACE usage depends on the number of locks and the number of
   processes waiting for locks. To estimate lock space needs, here is a rule
   of thumb:

     o 1.5KiB overhead for the lock space, plus
     o 640 bytes for each lock base name, plus
     o 128 bytes for each subscript, plus
     o 128 bytes for each waiting process.

   Generally, you would limit LOCK_SPACE only when memory is scarce or you
   want to be made aware of unexpected levels of LOCK usage. For most other
   cases, there is no reason to limit the LOCK_SPACE. If you are introducing
   new code, FIS recommends using TSTART and TCOMMIT as a more efficient
   alternate for most LOCKs because it pushes the responsibility for
   Isolation onto GT.M, which internally manages them with optimistic
   algorithms.

   -M[UTEX_SLOTS]=integer

   Specifies the number of mutex slots for a database file. GT.M uses mutex
   slots to manage database contention. FIS recommends you configure the
   slots to cover the maximum number of processes you expect to concurrently
   access the database file, as an insufficient number of slots can lead to
   much steeper and more severe degradation of performance under heavy loads.
   The minimum is 1Ki and the maximum is 32Ki.

   -R[ESERVED_BYTES]=size

   Specifies the size to be reserved in each database block. RESERVED_BYTES
   is generally used to reserve room for compatibility with other
   implementations of M or to observe communications protocol restrictions.
   RESERVED_BYTES may also be used as a user-managed fill factor.

   The minimum RESERVED_BYTES is zero bytes.

   The maximum Reserved_Bytes is the block size minus the size of the block
   header (which is 7 or 8 depending on your platform) minus the maximum
   record size.

   By default, GDE uses a RESERVED_BYTES size of zero bytes.

2 Gblname_Qualifiers
   Gblname Qualifiers

   The following -GBLNAME qualifier can be used with the ADD, CHANGE, or
   TEMPLATE commands.

   -C[OLLATION]=collation_number

   Specifies the collation number for a global name; a value of 0 specifies
   standard M collation. The first time that a GT.M processes accesses a
   global variable name in a database file, it determines the collation
   sequence as follows:

     o If a Global Variable Tree (GVT) exists (that is, global variable nodes
       exist, or have previously existed, even if they have been KILL'd), use
       the existing collation:

          o If there is a collation specified in the Directory Tree (DT) for
            that variable, use it after confirming that this matches the
            collation in the global directory.
          o else (that is, there is no collation specified in the DT):

               + If there is collation specified for that global variable in
                 the global directory use it
               + else if there is a default for that database file, use it
               + else (that is, neither exists), use standard M collation

     o else (that is, a GVT does not exist, which in turn means there is no
       DT):

          o If there is collation specified for that global variable in the
            global directory use it
          o else, if there is a default for that database file, use it
          o else (that is, neither exists), use standard M collation

2 Instance_Qualifier
   Instance Qualifier

   The following -INSTANCE qualifier is used with the CHANGE command.

   -F[ILE_NAME=[repl_inst_filename|""]

     o -FILE_NAME=repl_inst_filename maps a replication instance file with
       the global directory. -FILE_NAME="" removes the mapping of a global
       directory with a replication instance file.
     o When a global directory is use, the mapping set with CHANGE -INSTANCE
       FILE_NAME=repl_inst_filename overrides any setting of the
       gtm_repl_instance environment variable. However, other utilities
       (MUPIP, LKE, and DSE) use the setting of the gtm_repl_instance
       environment variable.
