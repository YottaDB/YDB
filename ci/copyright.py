    # Note:
    # 1.
    # Following commands are helpful to identify file extensions which can be added to this map.
    # To list extensions with file count `find . -type f | sed -e 's/.*\.//' | sed -e 's/.*\///' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`.
    # To find files with specific extension `find ./ -type f -name "*.ext"`.
    # 2.
    # `needs_copyright.sh` in different repo's takes care of skipping files which doesn't need the copyright related changes
    # so even if an extension doesn't apply to that repo it should be fine to have it in the mapping. Example case is `.txt`
    # which is excluded in YDBPython isn't in YDB.
    # 3.
