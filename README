The make file enclosed (sr_unix/comlist.mk) will build GT.M from source.  
The only prerequisite is GNU make and Linux x86.   GNU make  3.79.1 and 
Redhat 7.2 were used to do the test builds for this distribution.

To build a production version GT.M for linux do the following steps:
1. cd <gtm-directory> 	#<gtm-directory> is where all sr_* directories copied/checked out.
2. Define an environment variable 'gtm_curpro' to point to the full path of the prior GT.M installation.
   Download and install GT.M binary distribution from SourceForge if you do not have 
   GT.M installed already. The build procedure needs an existing GT.M mumps installed
   on the machine.
   Example:
   	gtm_curpro=<installation-directory>; export gtm_curpro	#bourne shell
   	export gtm_curpro=<installation-directory> 		#bash shell
	setenv gtm_curpro <installation-directory>		#tcsh shell
3. Building GT.M -
By default, the gmake will build a production version GT.M. The build type of GT.M
can be controlled by a parameter "buildtypes" - dbg (debug), bta (beta),
and pro (production).   Passing a subset of dbg, bta, or pro in "buildtypes"
from the environment or the command line will build that subset. For example:

	gmake -f sr_unix/comlist.mk -I./sr_unix -I./sr_linux buildtypes=dbg gtm_ver=<gtm-directory>

will build just a debuggable GT.M release.

4. Packaging GT.M -
Once the required builds have been done the object distribution can be
tar'ed by doing:

	gmake -f sr_unix/comlist.mk -I./sr_unix -I./sr_linux gtm_ver=<gtm-directory> package

Again, buildtypes can be used to package just a subset. For example:

	gmake -f sr_unix/comlist.mk -I./sr_unix -I./sr_linux buildtypes=pro gtm_ver=<gtm-directory> package
