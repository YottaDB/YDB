GT.M relies on CMake to generate the Makefiles to build GT.M from source. The
prerequisites are CMake (at least 2.8.5), GNU make (at least 3.81), Linux
(either x86 or x86_64), libraries and development files for libz, Unicode,
OpenSSL and GPG. Debian 6, Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 LTS and RHEL 6.0 were used to do
the test builds for this distribution. The default ICU and GPG packages were
taken from the distribution repositories.

To build GT.M for Linux, do the following steps:

1. Fulfill the pre-requisites
   Install developement libraries libelf, zlib, libicu, libgpgme, libgpg-error,
   libgcrypt, libssl, libconfig.

   Ensure that your locale settings are correct, otherwise you will see
   GTM-E-NONUTF8LOCALE messages. Refer the Messages and Recovery Procedures
   Manual if you do encounter these messages. The following should give you a
   valid locale:

   $ locale -a | gawk 'BEGIN{IGNORECASE=1}/en_us.utf-*8/{print;exit}'
   en_US.utf8
   $ export LANG=C LC_ALL= LC_CTYPE="<answer from above>" LC_COLLATE=C

   [optional] The GT.M source tarball includes pre-generated files. To generate
   these files requires a binary distribution of GT.M.  You can download GT.M
   from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/ Unpack the tar file and run
   the configure script as root. Note: the tar file unpacks everything into
   your current working directory, not a new subdirectory. The Linux Standard
   Base (LSB) install path for GT.M V6.2-002 is /opt/fis-gtm/V6.2-002_i586 or
   /opt/fis-gtm/V6.2-002_x8664. These instructions are written using x8664, please
   use i586 as necessary.

   $ tar xfz gtm_V62002_linux_x8664_pro.tar.gz

   # Note down the installation path for use with cmake below

   $ sudo sh ./configure

2. Unpack the GT.M sources
   The GT.M source tarball extracts to a directory with the version number in
   the name, fis-gtm-V6.2-002
   $ tar xfz fis-gtm-V6.2-002.tar.gz
   $ cd fis-gtm-V6.2-002

   You should find this README, LICENSE, COPYING and CMakeLists.txt file and
   sr_* source directories.

3. Building GT.M -
   <fis-gtm-build> can be a sub directory of the source directory,
   fis-gtm-V6.2-002, or any other valid path.

   $ mkdir <fis-gtm-build>
   $ cd <fis-gtm-build>

   # [optional] If you installed GT.M, provide the directory path to cmake
   #   -D GTM_DIST:PATH=$gtm_dist
   #
   # By default the build produces release versions of GT.M. To build a debug
   # version of GT.M supply the following parameter to cmake
   #     -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
   #
   # Note that the cmake install does not create the final installed GT.M.
   # Instead, it stages GT.M for distribution. Change the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
   # to place the staged files in a local directory. To install GT.M, you must
   # cd to that installed directory and execute the configure script.
   #
   #     -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${PWD}/package
   #
   $ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${PWD}/package <path to>/fis-gtm-V6.2-002

   $ make

   $ make install

   $ cd package/lib/fis-gtm/V6.2-002_x86_64

   # Now you are ready to install GT.M. Answer a few questions and install it.
   # The recommended installation path is /opt/fis-gtm/V6.2-002_x86_64

   $ sudo ./configure

   $ make clean

4. Packaging GT.M -
   Create a tar file from the installed directory

FAQ:

	CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
	Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
  This indicates that required libraries are not found. Please consult the list
