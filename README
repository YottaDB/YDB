GT.M relies on CMake to generate the Makefiles to build GT.M from source. The
prerequisites are CMake (at least 2.8.5), GNU make (at least 3.81), Linux
(either x86 or x86_64), libraries and development files for libz, Unicode,
OpenSSL and GPG. Debian 7, Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 LTS and RHEL 6.0 were used to do
the test builds for this distribution. The default ICU and GPG packages were
taken from the distribution repositories.

To build GT.M for Linux, do the following steps:

1. Fulfill the pre-requisites
   Install developement libraries
   cmake tcsh {libconfig,libelf,libgcrypt,libgpg-error,libgpgme11,libicu,libncurses,libssl,zlib1g}-dev
   There may be other library dependencies or the packages may have different names
   If CMake issues a NOTFOUND error, please see the FAQ below.

2. Unpack the GT.M sources
   The GT.M source tarball extracts to a directory with the version number in
   the name, fis-gtm-V6.3-003A
   $ tar xfz fis-gtm-V6.3-003A.tar.gz
   $ cd fis-gtm-V6.3-003A

   You should find this README, LICENSE, COPYING and CMakeLists.txt file and
   sr_* source directories.

3. Building GT.M -
   <fis-gtm-build> can be a sub directory of the source directory,
   fis-gtm-V6.3-003A, or any other valid path.

   $ mkdir <fis-gtm-build>
   $ cd <fis-gtm-build>

   # [optional] If you installed GT.M, provide the directory path to cmake
   #   -D GTM_DIST:PATH=$gtm_dist
   #
   # By default the build produces release versions of GT.M. To build a debug
   # version of GT.M supply the following parameter to cmake
   #     -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
   #
   # Note that the cmake install does not create the final installed GT.M.
   # Instead, it stages GT.M for distribution. Change the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
   # to place the staged files in a local directory. To install GT.M, you must
   # cd to that installed directory and execute the configure script.
   #
   #     -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${PWD}/package
   #
   $ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${PWD}/package <path to>/fis-gtm-V6.3-003A

   $ make

   $ make install

   $ cd package/lib/fis-gtm/V6.3-003A_x86_64

   # Now you are ready to install GT.M. Answer a few questions and install it.
   # The recommended installation path is /opt/fis-gtm/V6.3-003A_x86_64

   $ sudo ./configure

   $ make clean

4. Packaging GT.M -
   Create a tar file from the installed directory

FAQ:
- The CMake build fails with the following message followed by one or more cases.
	CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
	Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
  This indicates that required libraries are not found. Please consult the list
  of libraries and check your distributions package manager.
